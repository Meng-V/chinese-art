此唐周昉畫《內人雙陸圖》也。攷宋郭若虛《圖畫見聞志》云 : 「周昉善属文，窮丹青之妙，多游卿相間，貴公子也」。此圖畫二女子對奕雙陸，一女舉一子將下，一女坐而凝思，一女扶一婢旁觀，另有女婢二人，共舁一水壺。阮元所著《石渠隨筆》卷八，載周昉《內人雙陸圖卷》絹本著色，人物所畫共八人，無款，而未詳言畫意。惟劉孝基題詩云 :「睡起深宮未梳沐，供湯侍婢走匍匐」云云。圖中二婢共舉一水壺，當指「供湯侍婢」，旁觀女子首籠白帕，鬢鬟未整，亦與「未梳沐」之言合。其言畫中八人，但有六人者，必是年代久遠，畫絹一段失去。其設雙陸之几，照畫理論應設于中央，今既偏於右邊，是必失去一段，故畫中亦失去二人。至其畫，陸師道跋語謂:「設色精妙絕倫，如良工之無斧鑿痕，視之皆有生意」，皆與此卷相合，詢非虛語。《圖畫見聞志》云:「作仕女，宜有秀色婑媠之態」。此圖寫內人奕雙陸，旁觀者侍婢，奔走憨嬌之態，無不一一傳出，曲盡其妙。斷非宋人所能學步，定為周昉真蹟之僅存者，殊可寶也。丁丑六月褚德彝記。 雙陸始于西印度，即《涅槃經》之波羅塞戲。其流入中國，則始于魏之曹植。宋洪遵《雙陸序》云 :「以異木為盤，盤中彼此，內外各有六枚，故名」。今日本尚有雙陸，黑白棋各十六枚，共三十二枚。
This is the picture Palace Ladies Playing Double Sixes, painted by Zhou Fang [ca. 730–ca. 800] of the Tang dynasty. In his Experiences in Painting, Guo Ruoxu [ca. 1060–1110) of the Song dynasty said: ―Zhou Fang was good at literary composition and exhausted all the subtleties of painting. He often socialized with high officials and wealthy young men-about-town.‖3 The picture shows two women playing a game of double sixes: one holds up a piece and is about to set it down, while the other sits in deep concentration.4 A third woman leans on a serving girl and watches from the side, as two other serving girls carry in a container of water.
Chapter eight in the Shiqu suibi written by Ruan Yuan [1764–1849] records an unsigned handscroll painting [titled] Palace Ladies Playing Double Sixes, done in color on silk, with a total of eight figures, but it provides no details about the idea of the painting.5 A poem by Liu Xiaoji inscribed [on the scroll] says: ―They rise from sleep deep in the palace, not yet combed or bathed / Bringing hot water, the serving girls come creeping in at a crawl.‖6 The phrase ―the serving girls come creeping in at a crawl‖ indicates the two maids in the painting who are bringing in the container of hot water, while the woman watching [the game] from the side whose head is covered with a white cloth and whose hair is not yet put to rights, also conforms to the phrase ―not yet combed or bathed.‖ The fact that [Ruan Yuan‘s account] says that there are eight figures in the painting, but here there are only six, must be because a section of the painting silk was cut away at some point in the distant past. The double-sixes table, which logically should be at the center of the picture, is at present off to the right side, so this must be where the missing section was located, and therefore where the two figures were removed. In his colophon, Lu
Shidao [1511–1574] said of [the painting]: ―the application of color is marvelously refined and beyond compare, and just as ‗skilled craftsmanship shows no mark of hatchet or chisel,‘ the work is very lifelike to look upon.‖7 As this is entirely consistent with [the painting on] this scroll, [the above ] statement is certainly not without substance. In his Experiences in Painting, [Guo
Ruoxu] said, ―court ladies should be depicted as feminine and comely in appearance.‖8 While this picture shows palace ladies playing a game of double-sixes, the demeanor of each onlooker and serving girl—whether hurried and rushed, or foolish and spoiled—is individually conveyed in the utmost marvelous detail. As this is decidedly not something that any Song dynasty [artist] could learn to do, [the painting] can be authenticated as the only genuine surviving work by Zhou Fang, and should be most especially treasured. Recorded by Chu Deyi in the sixth lunar-month of the dingchou year [July 8–August 5, 1937].
The game ―double sixes‖ originated in western India, and was [known as] boluosaixi in the Mahaparinirvana sutra. Cao Zhi [192–232] of the Wei dynasty was the first to play [the game] when it made its way to China. In his ―Introduction to Double Sixes‖ (Shuanglu xu), Hong Zun [1120–1174] of the Song dynasty said: ―The playing-board is made from different kinds of wood, and each side has six interior and six exterior pieces; thus the name.‖9 Double sixes is still played in Japan to this day, and each side has sixteen pieces, either black or white, for a total of thirty-two pieces.10

繪事之傳久矣，自漢晉始，唐宋為最盛。其間以畫名者，不知凡幾，如山水、人物、仕女、花卉、翎毛、走獸、昆虫之類，俱各擅所長。其所最重[者*]圖像者，蓋以其與史事相表裏，皆有關政治學問，非徒以工麗巧飾為能也。漢人則有《歷代帝王像》，諸葛武侯有《八陣圖》，曹弗興有《兵符圖》，毛惠遠有《列女像》，曹霸有《功臣像》，張僧繇有《夜月觀泉圖》，展子虔有《遊春圖》，閻立本有《孔子弟子像》，陳閎有《八公圖》，張擇端有《清明上河圖》。或以隆盛德也，重軍旅也，褒烈忠也，紀勝遊也，興文教也，慎政治也，諫君上也，皆有所感發而作也。右周文矩《李後主觀棋圖》。余弱冠時，曾於張都諫家見之。其神采、衣紋、絹色、傅采，皆古穆渾厚。前有宋思陵瘦金書「周文矩李後主觀棋圖」九字，在隔水綾上。後蘇軾、胡完夫、陳直齋、鮮于樞、柯九思諸跋，洵稱至寶。癸亥九月十日過王子履亨齋中，出此見示。其筆墨精妙，與都諫所藏無异，的是唐人真品。第諸題跋不知何時為俗手割去，歎惜竟日。因題數語歸之履亨，其善寶諸。延陵吳寬。*注 : [者]字被點去。
[First section not translated]…..At right is the picture Last Ruler Li Watching a Game of Weiqi. When I was newly capped [at age nineteen: 1455], I once saw this painting at the home of Censor Zhang. …On the mounting silk in front [of the painting], Emperor Siling [Gaozong] of the Song dynasty [reigned 1127–62] had inscribed nine characters in slender gold [calligraphy]: Last Ruler Li Watching a Game of Weiqi.4 Mounted behind were several colophons by Su Shi [1037–1101], Hu Wanfu [Zongyu, 1029–1094], Chen Zhizhai [Zhensun, ca. 1183–ca. 1261], Xianyu Shu [1246–1302], and Ke Jiusi [1290– 1343], all of which were extremely valuable. On the tenth day of the ninth lunar-month in the guihai year [September 29, 1503], I visited the studio of Master Wang Lüheng [unidentified, see Collector Seals], who brought out this scroll to show me. Its brushwork and ink are subtle and refined, and there are no differences with the [painting] owned by the Censor, so it is certainly a genuine work by an artist of the [Southern] Tang period [937–75]. I do not know when some vulgar hand cut off the [front] inscription and all the colophons, but I sighed in regret [over it] the whole day.5 Thus I have inscribed a few words and am returning [the scroll] to [Wang] Lüheng, that he may treasure it well.

此南唐畫院周文矩所畫李中主璟兄弟四人圍棋之象，宋人稱為《重屏圖》者也。見陸友仁《硯北襍志》卷二，原本畫于屏風。畫中又有屏上繪白樂天詩意，故曰重屏。至宋祐陵得之，始裝為軸而書白詩于上。中座當為南唐中主，見王明清《揮麈三錄》卷三，宋思陵始誤題為《後主觀棋圖》。非樓宣獻出示明8清，非明清以家藏中主象核對，亦莫辨其為中主也。中主兄弟五人，楚王景遷前卒，則此三人為晉王景遂、齊王景達、江王景逷矣。而孰為遂，孰為達，孰為逷，雖明清亦不能一一証之耳。榻上右首有古銅投壺一，壺中有矢三，榻上有矢二未投；傍有奕譜匣一；左有橫几，橫几上宮奩一、藤隱囊一、元匣一。傍有童子俯首而立，神情飄舉，眞有頰上添手之妙。南宋之季，為樓宣獻大防所藏，劉後村為之跋，亦見《硯北襍志》。後經柯九思、王履亨、項元汴、王阮亭諸家所藏，故裱綾有『縕真齋』、『王履亨』、『項元汴』、『王士禎』諸印，相傳皆沿後主觀棋之誤。余考訂諸書，証中座為中主，復題《重屏圖》舊名。千年舊物一旦豁然，雖絹敝墨渝，而神采如生，誠可寶也，誠可快也。白樂天《偶眠詩》云 : 「放杯書案上，枕臂火爐前，老愛尋思事，慵多取次眠，妻教卸烏帽，婢與展青氈，便是屏風樣，何勞畫古賢？」；亦見《硯北襍志》。惜徽宗御書白詩不可得見耳。光緒壬辰十月，歸安陸心源剛父題。丙午八月，烏程李延适書。

I once saw a horse painting by Chen Hong of the Tang dynasty and could only sigh at its
exquisite artistry, but looking now at Zhongmu’s [Zhao Yong’s] copy of a work by Li Boshi, I
see that he is truly able to carry on as his successor.9 As for the Central Asian leading the horse,10
[Zhao] has captured his demeanor to the utmost, [so when he wrote] ―it is a work that, as they
say, totally agrees with my mental concept,‖ he was not just referring to the [horse’s]
―cloudcovered form.‖11 This picture was painted by Zhongmu for his younger brother Yi, and
later came into the collection of Gu Zhongying from Kunshan.12 Since antiquity, the bones of
thousand-league horses have rotted away leaving nothing behind, yet after more than two
hundred years, the vigor and vitality of this [painted] steed remain the same as ever on this length of silk. What horse in the Twelve Celestial Stables can boast as much?13 Inscribed by Wu Kuan

The reason most paintings in the [Ming] imperial collection have no inscriptions or colophons by
earlier writers is that they were cut off when [the scrolls] became imperial property for fear they
might contain taboo words or expressions that were not altogether respectful. During the time of
Zhu Chengguo [1516–1572], this painting was given by the commissariat in lieu of official
salary.3 The title at the beginning of the scroll [reading], “Nymph of the Luo River, by Gu
Kaizhi,” had been lost by the time [the painting] passed into my hands; however, the seals Xiyuchi
and Longxi from the personal collection of Li Boshi [Li Gonglin] can [still] be distinguished.4 Of
all the paintings by Gu Changkang [Gu Kaizhi] within the four seas, only this scroll and the
Admonitions of the Instructress in the collection of Mister Xiang [Yuanbian, 1525– 1590]5
are
truly precious relics of famous painting.6

此卷畫之高名，不待贊嘆；顧無唐宋人題識，香光所鑒自不誣。然余考張懷瓘《畫斷》所
載虎頭畫約三十通，無《洛神圖》；裴孝源《貞觀公私畫史》所載十七卷，亦無之；《宣
和畫譜》所載九卷有《女史箴》亦無此圖。然则香光所指内府，並唐宋而言之，而《貞觀
畫史》卻有晉明帝《洛神賦圖》，豈本為晉明帝而或傳為虎頭耶。卷首有梁蕉林題籤，亦
指為愷之，後人固無庸異議矣。光緒丁未三月，宜都楊守敬。
The great fame of this handscroll painting does not attend my commendation, and of course
Xiangguang [Dong Qichang] was not mistaken in his expert opinion as to why there are no Tang
or Song dynasty inscriptions [on the scroll]. However, according to my research, the Nymph of
the Luo River does not appear among the thirty paintings by Hutou [Gu Kaizhi] recorded in
Zhang Huaiguan‟s Judgements on Paintings [early to mid-8th century]. Neither is it among the
seventeen paintings [by Gu] recorded in Pei Xiaoyuan‟s Records of Paintings in Public and
Private Collections during the Zhenguan Reign Period [preface 639], nor is the painting among
the nine scrolls [by Gu] recorded in the Imperial Catalogue of the Xuanhe Era [preface 1120],
which includes his [painting] Admonitions of the Instructress. Nevertheless, when Xiangguang
referred to imperial collections he was surely speaking about those of the Tang and Song dynasties, and since the Records of Paintings during the Zhenguan Reign Period does record a
painting called Painting of the ‘Rhapsody on the Nymph of the Luo River’ by Emperor Ming of
the Jin dynasty [reigned 323–25], could it not be that this painting was originally by Emperor
Ming, but somehow [erroneously] transmitted as having been done by Hutou?7 At the beginning
of the scroll, a label slip by Liang Jiaolin [Liang Qingbiao] also attributes the painting to [Gu]
Kaizhi, so later people most assuredly would have seen no need to express a different opinion.

Oh, to go home!
Field and garden will be weeds, how can I not go home?
Since I made my mind my body’s thrall, How
very sad and sorry I have been.
I know not to blame what is done and gone,
And am aware I must follow what’s to come;
As I’ve not strayed too far from the path,
I feel today is right and yesterday wrong.
Far, far, fares my boat with the gentle breeze,
Wind whirls and swirls, flapping my robes;
I ask other travelers about the road ahead,
And grudge that morning’s light is still so faint.
Then I glimpse the eaves of home,
I leap for joy and start to run, Serving
boys welcome me with cheer, My
young sons await me at the gate.
The three trails are all overgrown,
But pine and chrysanthemum remain;

攜幼入[室]，[有]酒盈樽。引壺觴以自酌，眄庭[柯以]怡顏，倚南[窗]以[寄傲]，審
容膝之易孜。
Leading my children I enter the house,
Where a pitcher is brimming with wine.
Pulling toward me cup and jug, I pour myself a drink,
Spying the trees in the courtyard, I am happy of face;
Leaning at the southern window, I convey my pride, How
easy it is to be content with just a little space.
Silk section 3: dimensions: 37.0 x 57.4 cm (Text 3: W 6.1 cm; Painting 3: W 51.3 cm)
3 columns, running-standard script (lines 25–32 of poem)
園日涉以成趣，門雖設而常關，策扶老以流憩，時矯首而遐觀。雲無心而出岫，鳥
倦飛而知還，景翳翳以將入，撫孤松而盤桓。
I pass my days in the garden doing what I please,
And though I set a gate there, it is always shut; An
old man leaning on his cane, I stroll and rest,
Lifting my head at times to gaze into the distance.
As clouds aimlessly emerge from the peaks,
Birds weary of flying know it is time to return;
But until the sun is covered and almost gone,
I stroke the bark of a lonely pine and linger on.
Silk section 4: dimensions: 37.0 x 64.8 cm (Text 4: W 8.2 cm; Painting 4, W 56.6 cm)

歸去來兮！請息交以絕游，世與我而相遺，復駕言兮焉求？悅親戚之情話，樂琴書
以消憂，農人告予以暮春，將有事乎西疇。
Oh, to go home!
I will cancel my friendships and cease to roam;
The world and I shall put each other aside,
Were I to yoke my carriage, what should I seek?
I’m happy having heartfelt talks with kith and kin,
Dissolving my cares in the joy of zither and books;
The farmers tell me that spring is near its end,
And there’s work to do out in the western fields.

或命巾車，或棹孤舟，既窈窕以尋壑，亦崎嶇而經丘；木欣欣以向榮，泉涓涓而始
流，善萬物之得時，感吾生之行休。
At times I order up my covered cart,
At times I row upon my lonely skiff, Exploring
up the canyons, hidden and secluded,
Or taking rough and rugged paths across the hills.
As trees happily approach the time of blooming,
And the fountains bubble up and start to flow,
Glad the myriad things have each their season,
I am moved that my own life must have an end.

3 columns, running-standard script (lines 49–56 of poem)
已矣乎！寓形孙內復幾時，曷不委心任去留，胡為遑遑欲何之！富貴非吾願，帝鄉
不可期，懷良辰以孤往，或植杖而耘耔。
All is over and done!
How much longer will my body sojourn in this world?
Why not let my heart decide whether to leave or stay?
Why hustle and bustle about? Where is it I would go?
Wealth and station are not what I desire,
And I have no expectation of reaching heaven,
But I cherish going out alone on a fine morning, And
planting my staff at times to weed and hoe.
Silk section 6: dimensions: 37.0 x 64.2 cm (Text 7: W 7.3 cm; Painting 7: W 56.9 cm)

登東皋以舒嘯，臨清流而賦詩，聊乘化以歸盡，樂夫天命復奚疑。
I climb the eastern bank, whistling loud and long,
And overlooking the clear stream, compose a poem; l
shall ride with the changes until the final return,
Happy in heaven’s decree, what is there to doubt?

往在山谷處，見伯時所作《歸去來》小屏，意趣簡遠，與此畫氣象畧相似。山谷指
淵明，語余曰：『伯時寫照，於此最得體，蓋大小四五軰不同，而姿狀若一故也。
觀其邁往不屑之韻，一時要貴，豈能挽致之？』然世或論淵明與二踈，以謂二踈既出知反，而淵明未嘗出，既出知反，如從病得愈，氣味勝於初不病。余以為不然。
二踈以師傅恩，行止足計，雖涉世網，而未嘗病。淵明之出則病矣，知病之不可嘗
而不深犯。計此風流，未肯遽出二踈下也。汝陰勝士王性之以此本示余，得以想見

Once, at Shangu’s [Huang Tingjian’s, 1045–1105] place I saw a small [painted] screen
with Going Home done by Boshi [Li Gonglin, ca. 1049–1106].9
Its concept was simple
but far-reaching, and in atmosphere it was generally similar to this [painting]. Shangu
pointed at [the figure of Tao] Yuanming and said to me: ―Boshi’s figure painting is at
its best in this [screen]. The reason is because [although Tao appears] in several groups of
different size, his demeanor is always the same. Seeing by his mood that he disdained
setting forth, how could the wealthy and powerful of the time hold him back?‖ Still, some
people in the world compare Yuanming and the two [tutors surnamed] Shu,10 saying that
the two Shus left [home to accept official employment], but knew when to return, while
Yuanming never actually left, and that leaving and knowing when to return is like getting
well after an illness: one’s sense of taste is better than if one had not at first been ill.11 I
do not think this is right. As the two Shus served as tutors by [imperial] favor, they were
[astute] enough to plan their times of going and staying, and although they experienced
the problems of the world, they never felt sick [of it]. But as soon as Yuanming left
[home], he was indeed sick of [the world], and as he knew that he could not help being
sick of it, it wasn’t really worth [going on]. Observing Tao’s deportment and manner, I
am not willing to place him too hastily below the two Shus. When the eminent Wang
Xingzhi of Ruyin showed me this scroll, I could visualize the joy of returning to one’s
fields and garden, and had the sense that the old fellow [Tao Qian] had not gone so very
far away from others [after all].12 Fifth day of the third lunar-month in the fourth year of the Daguan reign period [March 26, 1110], written by Li Peng Shanglao from south of

《歸去來辭》 陶淵明
歸去來兮，田園將蕪胡不歸！既自以心為形役，奚惆悵而獨悲？悟已往之不諫，知
來者之可追，實迷途其未遠，覺今是而昨非。
舟搖[搖]以輕颺，風飄[飄]而吹衣，問征夫以前路，恨晨光之意微。
乃瞻衡孙，載欣載奔，僮僕懽迎，稚子候門；三逕就荒，松菊猶存，攜幼入室，有

引壺觴以自酌，眄庭柯以怡顏，倚南[窗]以寄傲，審容膝之易孜。園日涉以成趣，
門雖設而常關，策扶老以流憩，時矯首而游觀。雲無心以出岫，鳥倦飛而知還，景
翳翳以將入，撫孤松而盤桓。
歸去來兮！請息交以絕游，世與我而相遺，復駕言兮馬求？
悅親戚之情話，樂琴書以消憂，農人告予以春及，將有事於西疇。
或命巾車，或棹孤舟，既窈窕以尋壑，亦崎嶇而經邱；
木欣[欣]而向榮，泉涓涓而始流，羨萬物之得時，感吾生之行休。已矣乎！寓形孙
內復幾時，曷不委心任去留，胡為乎遑欲何之！富貴非吾願，帝鄉不可期，懷良辰

Ink on second brown endpaper. Dimensions: 37.0 x 92.9 cm.
30 columns, standard script.
右宋李伯時所畫《陶淵明歸去來詞圖》，卷後有李商老跋。又考吳潛庵《書畫
緣》，知商老亦北宋人。跋中言及『往在山谷處』云云，考山谷為治平進士，伯時
為元祐進士，是三人均北宋同時人也。畫係絹本分段，每段後書《歸去來詞》，共
成七段。披觀之下，玩味不盡，而分段書文布置井。然誠《歸去來辭》之畫，非略
寫大意柴桑隱士畫也。李跋謂『意趣閑遠，寫照得體』，是也。又李跋引漢二疏去
官歸隱，相提並論，謂淵明『風流未肯遽出二疏下』，其評亦充。然二疏與淵明，
爵位與時勢俱不同，而其為知幾則一。所謂儗必於倫，其知言哉。
予因李跋引二疏以擬淵明而有慨焉。夫六書之旨，首在象形指事。古來畫法，本
由六書象形而生，『善可為法，惡可戒』，是也。商老因伯時之畫，顧亭林云：『
古人圖畫皆指事之使觀者可法可戒』，是也。淵明去官高隱，而念及於二疏之辭位
歸里，不知二疏當日罷官而歸，其祖道都門，後世固亦流為丹青名迹也。考昌黎《
送楊少尹序》言 : 『疏廣、受二子，以年老一朝辭位而去。於是兯卿設祖道都門，
車數百輛，道旁觀者多歎息泣下，某言其賢。漢史既傳其事，而後世之畫又圖其跡
』。是二疏去官，後世亦有圖畫之流傳，在昌黎時，當必親見其畫本，故詳悉言之
也。夫漢以後，畫家推顧、陸，唐時推吳、張，宋初推荊、關、董、巨，其著名尤
在伯時上。二疏畫本，當必出於數子之手，亦未可知。其遺幀尤堪寶貴，第不知尚
有存於孙宙間者否。然漢晉卓行高人，志同道合，觀此歸隱柴桑之畫本，亦如見祖
道都門之畫本也。則觀淵明畫，犹觀二疏畫，謂二疏圖畫仍存於今世，無不可也。
北宋之名迹，已自寥寥，今獲觀斯帙，不可謂非眼福，是誠希世之寶也。磨挲之餘

When the old masters painted a picture, there had to be some [behavior] to either encourage or
caution against for them to do so. In these eight paintings by Ma Hezhi of the poem ―Seventh
Month‖ from the ―Odes of Bin,‖ everything to do with farming, hunting, and silk-making is
depicted in minute detail, and although he did not apply any color, the manner of expression is
sufficient unto itself to verify that no one but Hezhi could have created them. An early preface to
the Classic of Poetry reads: ―The Duke of Zhou explained the business of kingship to inform
King Cheng,‖ saying that ―as no one among the people suffers more severely than farmers, the
ruler of a country should take pity on them and give them rest,‖ and therefore [the Duke]
composed the poem [Seventh Month] to describe all their hardships and travails.9 Now viewing
these pictures by Hezhi, [the figures in them] look as if they were [actually] born during the
Zhou dynasty and living in the state of Bin, so authentic is their air of antiquity. How can one
even speak on the same day of other versions that make use of mineral pigments in order to
amuse the onlooker! Spring of the yimao year in the Jiajing reign period [1555], inscribed by

I have seen several handscrolls of Ma Hezhi‘s Illustrations of the Mao Poems; all were done in
colorful pigments and none in ink, and they frequently have the writing of Emperor Gaozong
[reigned 1127–62] inscribed in front. Only on this one scroll did [Ma Hezhi] not apply any color,
and his brushwork is clear and true with an antique plainness that gives [the paintings] a sense of
relaxed and untrammeled ease. Was it because the people of Bin founded their state on hard
work and frugality, and the whole 800-year course of the [Zhou dynasty] started from this, that
Hezhi wished to capture the idea in a profound way, and as he would not sully the simple truth
with powder of gold and mineral pigments, he therefore created these sublime works in ink? As
to whether Lady West looks more lovely in light make-up or thick, each viewer must use his own
innate discernment.10 Inscribed by Wang Zhideng.

At right are eight illustrations of Seventh Month from the Odes of Bin, painted in ink by Ma
Hezhi of the Song dynasty. Hezhi ―took Wu Daoyuan [active ca. 710–760] as his master in
painting and excelled at ‗trembling‘ brushwork.‖11 The brushwork in these illustrations is clear
and ―trembling,‖ and the atmosphere vivid and lively. The folds in the clothing fall gracefully, with the marvelous [quality] of flowing water and moving clouds; the vegetation and trees toss
wildly about with a look of swirling winds and dancing snow. Although Ma‘s artistry does not
come up to that of Longmian [Li Gonglin],12 in the barren prospect of the fields and the bitter toil
of the farmers, the emotional setting [of the work] is fully realized and the internal logic [of the
compositional elements] is without bounds.
Long ago, ―Siling [Emperor Gaozong] loved [Ma Hezhi‘s] painting, and wherever he
left a blank space in transcribing a text from the Mao Poems, he would later command Hezhi to
make an illustration [to fill it].‖13 A few lines from the Classic are written at the front of each
section in this scroll, but I do not know if they are from the brush of Siling or not. Only, the
second section depicts the meaning [of the lines], ―Taking choppers and hatchets / To lop the
far boughs and high,‖ from stanza three, but the text that is written there comprises the closing
few lines of stanza one, which are incompatible with the [adjoining] painting.14 The handwriting
[on this text strip] is also unlike that which appears before and after it, so I imagine that the
[original] strip may have been lost and the [current] text written in by some later person, who
simply did not pay close enough attention.
Impressed on the paper-join of the eighth panel is a large relief seal of Emperor
Zhangzong of the Jin dynasty [that reads], Qunyu zhong mi (Hidden among a host of jades),
which indicates that the scroll was once part of the imperial Jin collection.15 Mounted at the end
are two colophons whose ancient and graceful [writing style] is quite legible, one by Wen
Zhengming and one by Wang Zhideng. Wen‘s calligraphy took its writing style from Zhiyong,
and Wang‘s calligraphy continued the legacy of the [Director of the] Court of the Watches
[Ouyang Xun].16 For the frontispiece, Wen Zhengming wrote four characters in seal script,
―Ancient Scenes from the Odes of Bin,” which are so marvelously clear and strong that if they
were placed next to the Thousand-character Essay by Wuxing [Zhao Mengfu], it would not be
easy to tell which of them was senior and junior.17

poems (8x5) by Lou Shou 樓璹 (1090–1162).6 Each poem is written in a discretely
delineated panel that precedes the scene to which it relates.
Each: Title, plus 4 columns, seal script. Transcription by unknown calligrapher in standard
script at right. (Note: Whenever possible, the transcription below follows the seal script text)
1. Jinzhong 浸種 (soaking the seeds)
谿頭夜雨足，門外春水生，筠藍浸淺碧，嘉榖抽新萌。西疇將有事，耒耜隨晨興，隻雞祭
勾芒，再拜祈秋成。
2. Geng 耕 (ploughing)
東皋弌犁雨，布榖初催耕，綠野暗春曉，烏犍苦肩赬。 我銜勸農字，杖策東郊行
，永懷歷山下，法事關聖情。
3. Ba 杷 (raking)
雨笠冒宿霧，風簑擁春寒，破塊得甘澍 7
，齧塍浸微瀾。 泥深四蹏重，日莫兩股酸
，謂彼牛後人，著鞭無作難。
4. Chao 耖 (harrowing)
脫絝下田中，盎漿著塍尾，巡行徧畦畛，扶耖均泥滓。 遲遲春日斜，稍稍樵歌起，
薄莫佩牛歸，共浴前谿水。
5. Ludu 碌碡 (rolling) 
力田巧機事，利器由心匠，翩翩轉圜樞，衮衮鳴翠浪。三春欲盡頭，萬頃帄如掌，漸暄牛
已喘，長懷丙丞相。
6. Buyang 布秧 (sowing)
舊榖發新穎，梅黃雨生肥，下田初播殖，却行手奮揮。
明朝望帄疇，綠鍼刺風漪，審此弌寸根，行作合穗期。
7. Yuyin 淤蔭 (fertilizing)
殺艸聞吳兒，灑灰傳自祖，田田皆沃壤，泫泫流膏乳。 塍頭烏啄泥，谷口鳩喚雨
，敢朢稼如雲，工夫蓋如許。
8. Bayang 拔秧 (uprooting)
新秧初出水，渺渺翠琰齊，清晨且拔擢，父子爭提攜。旣沐青滿握，再櫛根無泥，及時趁
芒種，散著畦東西。
8
9. Chayang 插秧 (transplanting)
晨雨麥秋潤，午風槐夏涼，谿南與谿北，嘯歌插新秧。拋擲不停手，左右無亂行，我將教
秧馬，代勞民莫忘。
10. Yiyun 弌耘 (initial weeding)
時雨旣已降，良苗日懷新，去艸如去惡，務令盡陳根。
泥蟠任犢鼻，厀行生浪紋，眷惟聖天子，黨亦思鳥耘 8
。
11. Eryun 弍耘 (second weeding)
解衣日炙背，戴笠汗濡首，敢辭冒炎蒸，但欲去莨莠。壺漿與簞食，亭午來餉婦，要兒知
稼穡，豈曰事攜帅。
12. Sanyun 弎耘 (third weeding)
農田亦甚劬，三復事耘秄，經秊苦艱食，喜見苗薿薿。 老農念弌飽，對此出饞水
，願天均雨晹，滿野如雲委。
13. Guangai 灌溉 (irrigating) 揠苗鄙宋人，抱罋慙蒙莊，何如銜尾鴉，倒流竭池塘。
囗 9稏舞翠浪，蘧蒢生晝涼，斜陽耿衰柳，笑歌閒女郎。
14. Shouyi 收刈 (harvesting)
田家刈穫時，腰鎌競倉卒，霜濃手龜坼，日永息罄折。
兒童行拾穗，風色凌短褐，歡呼荷檐歸，朢朢屋山月。
15. Dengchang 登場 (stacking)
禾黍已登場，稍覺農事優，黃雲滿高架，白水空西疇。用此可卒歲，願言免防秋，太帄本
無象，村舍炊煙浮。
16. Chisui 持穗 (threshing)
霜時天氣佳，風勁木葉脫，持穗及此時，連枷聲亂發。
黃雞啄遺粒，烏鳥喜聒聒，歸家抖塵埃，夜屋燒榾柮。
17. Boyang 簸揚 (winnowing)
臨風細揚簸，糠粃零風歬，傾瀉雨聲碎，把翫玉粒圜。
短帬箕帚婦，收拾亦已專，豈圖較斗升，未敢忘凶秊。
18. Long 礲 (hulling) 推挽人摩肩，展轉石礪齒，
殷牀作春靁，旋風落雲子。
有如布山川，部婁勢相峙，歬持斗量珠，滿眼俄有此。
19. Chongdui 舂碓 (grinding)
娟娟月過牆，簌簌風吹葉，田家當此時，村舂響相荅。行聞炊玉香，會見流匙滑，更須水
轉輪，地碓勞蹴蹋。
20. Si 籭 (sifting)
茅檐閒杵臼，竹屋細籭簸，照人珠琲光，奮臂風雨過。計功初不淺，飽食良自賀，西鄰華
屋兒，醉飽正高臥。
21. Rucang 入倉 (storing)
天寒牛在牢，歲暮粟入庾，田父有餘樂，炙背臥檐廡。
却愁催賦租，胥吏來旁午，輸官王事了，索飯兒叫怒。

向蔣溥進劉松年《蠶織圖》，自序卷首，其蹟已入《石渠寶笈》矣。茲得松年《耕作圖》
，觀其筆法，與《蠶織圖》相類。因以二卷參較之，則紙幅長短、畫篆體格，悉無弗合。
《耕圖》卷後，姚式跋云，『《耕織圖》二卷，文簡程公曾孫棨儀甫繪而篆之』。《織圖
》卷後，趙子俊跋亦云，『每節小篆，皆隨齋手題』。今兩卷押縫，皆有『儀甫』、『隨
齋』二印，其為程棨摹樓璹圖本并書其詩無疑。細觀圖內『松年筆』三字，腕力既弱，復
無印記，蓋後人妄以松年有曾進《耕織圖》之事，從而傅會之，而未加深考，致以訛傳訛
耳。至《耕圖》『紹興』小璽，則又作偽者不知棨為元時人，誤添蛇足矣。又考兩卷題跋
，姚式而外諸人，皆每卷分題，則二卷在當時本相屬附，後乃分佚單行，故《耕圖》有項
元汴收藏諸印記，而《織圖》則無，可以騐其離合之由矣。今既為延津之合，因命同篋襲
弆，置諸御園多稼軒。軒之北為貴織山堂，皆皇考御額，所以重農桑而示後世也。昔皇祖
題《耕織圖》，泐板行世。今得此佳蹟合并，且有關重民衣食之本，亦將勒之貞石，以示
家法於有永。因考其源委，並識兩卷中，兼用璹韻題圖隙。至原書及偽欵，仍存其舊，蓋
所重在訂證覈實前此之誤，固不必為之文飾，亦瑕瑜不揜之道也。已丑上元後五日，御筆

Previously Jiang Pu [1708–1761] presented Liu Songnian’s Weaving Silk [to the throne] and [wrote] a preface at the beginning of the scroll, which indeed has already been entered in the Shiqu
baoji [catalogue of the imperial collection].2 Now We have acquired [Liu] Songnian’s Tilling Rice,
and its brushwork is observably quite similar to that of Weaving Silk. Upon further comparison of
the two scrolls, the dimensions of their paper as well as the styles of both their painting and seal
script [inscriptions] are entirely identical. At the end of the Tilling scroll, the colophon by Yao Shi
[see below, colophon 2] says, ―[Cheng] Qi, [courtesy name] Yifu, who was the great-grandson
of Duke Cheng Wenjian [Cheng Lin, 988-1056],3 painted [the illustrations] for the two scrolls
Tilling and Weaving and [wrote out the poems] in seal script,‖ while at the end of the Weaving
scroll, the colophon by Zhao Zijun [Zhao Mengyu, active 1290s–1330s] says, ―each passage of
seal script was written by the hand of Suizhai.‖ Now, as the paper joins [between the last illustration
and first colophon] of each scroll bear [impressions of the same] two seals reading Yifu and Suizhai,
there can be no doubt that it was Cheng Qi, who made [these] copies after Lou Shou’s
compositions and wrote out the poems. Upon closely examining the three-character [artist
signatures] on both paintings, reading ―brushed by [Liu] Songnian,‖ [one finds that] the writing
is quite weak and there are none of [Liu’s] seal impressions, so it is probable that some later
person— without making any deeper investigation [of the facts]—fallaciously added [the
signatures] to accord with the story that [Liu] Songnian had once presented the paintings Tilling
and Weaving [to the throne], thus perpetuating one falsehood through another. As for the small
[Song dynasty] imperial seal reading Shaoxing that appears on Tilling, this was also [impressed]
because the forger [of the seal] did not know that [Cheng] Qi was a man of the Yuan dynasty, and
so he erroneously ―added feet to the snake.‖ On further investigating the colophons [that appear]
on the two scrolls, all of the writers except Yao Shi separately inscribed each [scroll], so [it is clear
that] the two scrolls were together at some point, but later became separated and circulated
individually, which can be verified by [the fact that] Tilling bears numerous collector seals of
Xiang Yuanbian, while Weaving has none. As the two scrolls have now been [miraculously
reunited as the two swords] at Yan Ford, We have ordered that they be kept together in the same
box, and have placed them in the Duojia Pavilion in the imperial garden [of the Yuanmingyuan
palace]. North of the pavilion is Guizhi Mountain Hall, for which Our Late August Father
[Emperor Yongzheng] personally provided the name tablets, so as to emphasize agriculture and
sericulture and proclaim [their importance] to later generations. In the past, Our Late August
Grandfather [Emperor Kangxi] inscribed [a set of poems] for the Pictures of Tilling and Weaving,
woodblock prints of which are current in the world. Now We have been able to reunite these [two]
beautiful works, and as they concern the fundamentals of clothing and food for the common
people, We shall also have them engraved on stone, thereby proclaiming Our Family Regulations
for eternity. Accordingly, we have investigated [their history] from beginning to end and written
it on both scrolls, and have [composed a set of poems] using
[Lou] Shou’s rhymes to inscribe open spaces among the pictures. As to the original texts and fake
signatures, We shall preserve them as of old, for what is important is to examine the evidence and
establish the facts [to correct] earlier mistakes, and while one must certainly not gloss them over,
it is also a way to not allow such defects to obscure the excellence [of these paintings]. Fifth day

In front, We established that the two pictures Tilling and Weaving were copied by Cheng Qi
directly from Lou Shou. We had only investigated this through the colophons of Yao Shi and
others at the end of the scroll, and were aware that [Lou] Shou’s original version had definitely
not been seen. Now, in collating and compiling the Yongle dadian (Encyclopedia compiled in the
Yongle reign period), which records both the number of paintings in Lou Shou’s Pictures of Tilling
and Weaving and the poems that go with the scenes, [We find that] there is nothing that does not
entirely agree with Cheng’s scroll, and as this provides sufficient proof to confirm Our [previous]
investigation of the evidence, We record it here. First decade in the intercalary spring month of the

At right are the two handscrolls Tilling and Weaving, with Tilling [showing] all together twentyone steps [of production] and Weaving [showing] all together twenty-four steps. Each step has a
[separate] illustration, attached to which is a one-stanza poem in five-character meter, with eight
lines per stanza. This is the composition presented [to the throne] by Lou Shou of Siming, who
was a magistrate of Yuqian [district] in Lin’an [county] during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of
the Song dynasty [reigned 1127–62], and which is entirely consistent with [the subject matter] of
the poem Seventh Month in the Odes of Bin.
12 His grandsons [Lou] Hong and Shen once had the
poems carved into stone, and his nephew [Lou] Yue [1137–1213], who assisted the government
during the Jiading reign period [1208–24], wrote an inscription for it in which he set forth [Lou
Shou’s accomplishments].13 There is also a woodblock version of the illustrations circulating in
the world. [Cheng] Qi, [courtesy name] Yifu, who was the great-grandson of Duke Cheng
Wenjian14 and a man of broad cultivation, painted [the illustrations] and [wrote out the poems] in
seal script for his personal collection, [so this] may be termed a version based on [direct]
knowledge [of the original]. Viewers should not look upon it lightly. Yao Shi of Wuxing.

brought forth, all the other scrolls can be ignored, for ―the king considers the people to be

at this scroll not be moved by this? Crazy Old Man in the Mountans, Wu Wei.19

1. Yu can 浴蠶 (bathing the silkworm eggs)
農桑將有事，時節過禁煙，輕風歸燕日，小雨浴蠶天。春縿 19卷縞袂，盆池弄清泉，深宮
想齋戒，躬桑率民先。
2. Xia can 下蠶 (hatching the eggs)
榖雨無幾日，谿山煗 20風高，華蠶初破殼，落紙細於毛。
柔桑摘蟬翼，蔌蔌才容刀，茅檐紙窻明，未覺眼力勞。
3. Wei can 餵蠶 (feeding the worms)
蠶兒初飯時，桑葉如錢許，攀條摘鵝黃，藉紙觀螘 21聚。
屋頭草木長，窗下兒女語，日長人頗閒，鍼線隨緝補。
4. Yi mian 一瞑 22 (first molting)
蠶瞑白日靜，鳥語青春長，袌 23脛聊假寐，孰能事梳妝。
水邊多麗人，羅衣蹋春陽，春陽無限思，豈知問農桑。
5. Er mian 二瞑 (second molting)
吳蠶一再瞑，竹屋下簾幕，拍手弄嬰兒，一笑姑不惡。風來麥秀寒，雨過桑沃若，日高蠶
未起，谷鳥鳴百箔。
6. San mian 三瞑 (third molting)
屋裏蠶三瞑，門前春過半，桑麻綠陰合，風雨長檠暗。
葉底蟲絲繁，臥作字畫短，偷閒一枕肱，夢與楊華 24亂。
7. Fen bo 分箔 (separating silkworms onto screens) 三瞑三起餘，飽葉蠶局促，眾多旋分箔，蚤
晚磓滿屋。
郊原過新雨，桑柘沾 25濃綠，竹間快活吟，慙愧麥飽孰 26。
8. Cai sang 採桑 (gathering mulberry leaves)
吳兒歌採桑，桑下青春深，鄰里講歡好，遜畔無欺侵。
筠籃各自攜，筠梯高倍尋，黃鸝飽紫葚，啞吒 27鳴綠陰。
9. Da qi 大起 (awakening)
盈箱大起時，食葉聲似雨，春風老不知，蠶婦忙如許。
呼兒刈青麥，朝飯已過午，妖歌得綾羅，不易青帬女。
10. Zhuo ji 捉績 (choosing the mature silkworms)
麥黃雨初足，蠶老人愈忙，辛勤減瞑食，顚倒著衣裳。 絲腸映綠葉，練練金色光，
松明照夜屋，杒孙嗁 28東岡。
11. Shang cu 上蔟 (setting up the trellises)
采采綠葉空，剪剪白茅短，散 29蔟輕放手，蠶老絲腸媆。
山市浮晴嵐，風日作妍煗，會看繭如罋 30，纍纍光眩眼。
12. Zhi bo 炙箔 (warming the screens)
峨峨爇薪炭，重重下簾幕，初出蟲結網，遽若雪滿箔。老翁不勝勤，候火珠汗落，得閒兒
女子，困臥呼不覺。
13. Xia cu 下蔟 (taking down the trellises; or selecting cocoons)
晴明開雪屋，門巷排銀山，一秊蠶事辦，下蔟春向闌。鄰里兩相賀，翁媼弌 31笑歡，后妃
應獻繭，喜色天顏。
14. Ze jian 擇繭 (harvesting cocoons)
大繭至八蠶，小繭止獨蛹，繭衣繞指柔，收拾擬何用。
冬來作縹絖，與兒禦寒凍，衣帛非不能，責 32多租稅重。
15. Jiao jian 窖繭 (storing cocoons)
槃 33中水晶鹽，井上梧桐葉，陶器固封泥，窖繭過旬浹。
門前春水生，布榖催畚鍤，明朝蹋繅車，車輪纏白氎。
16. Sao si 繅絲 (reeling off silk from the cocoons)
連村煮繭香，解事誰家孃，盈盈意媚竈，拍拍手探湯。上盆顏色好，轉軸頭緒長，晚來得
少休，女伴語隔牆。
17. Can e 蠶蛾 (silkworm moths)
蛾初脫纏縳，如蝶栩栩然，得偶粉翅光，散子金粟圜。歲月判悠悠，種嗣期緜緜，送蛾臨
遠水，蚤歸屬明秊。
18. Si xie 祀謝 (offering thanks)
春前作蠶市，盛事傳西蜀，此邦亯 34先蠶，再拜絲滿目。
馬革裹玉肌，能神不為辱，雖云事渺茫，解與民為福。
19. Lao si 絡絲 (spooling) 
兒夫督機絲，輸官趁時節，向來催租瘢，正為坐踰越。
朝來掉籆 35勤，寧復辭腕脫，辛勤夜未瞑，敗屋燈明滅。
20. Jing 經 (preparing warp threads)
素絲頭緒多，羨君好安排，青鞵不動塵，緩步交去來。脉脉意欲亂，眷眷首重回，王言正
如絲，亦付經綸才。
21. Wei 緯 (preparing the weft threads)
浸緯供織作，寒女兩髻丫，繾綣一縷絲，成就百種華。
弄水春筍寒，卷輪蟾景 36鈄，人閒 37小阿香，晴空轉靁 38車。
22. Zhi 織 (weaving silk)
青鐙映幃幕，絡緯鳴井欄，軋軋揮素手，風露淒已寒。
辛勤度幾梭，始復成弌 39端，寄言羅綺伴，當念麻苧單。
23. Pan hua 攀華 (weaving patterned silk) 時態尚新巧，女工慕精勤，心手暗相應，照
眼華紛紜。殷勤挑錦字，曲折讀回文，更將無限思，織作鴈背雲。
24. Jian bo 剪帛 (cutting silk) 
低眉 40事機杼，細意把刀尺，盈盈彼美人，剪剪其束帛。輸官給邊用，辛苦何足惜，大勝
漢繚綾，粉涴不再著。

向蔣溥進此圖，自序卷首，題為劉松年蹟，已入《石渠寶笈》矣。玆得松年《耕作圖》，
觀其筆法，與此圖相類。因以二卷參校之，則紙幅長短、畫篆體格，悉無弗合。《耕圖》
卷後，姚式跋云: 『《耕織圖》二卷，文簡程公曾孫棨儀甫繪而篆之』。《織圖》卷後，
趙子俊跋亦云: 『每節小篆，皆隨齋手題』。今兩卷押縫，皆有『儀甫』、『隨齋』二印
，其為程棨摹樓璹圖本并書其詩無疑。細觀圖內『松年筆』三字，腕力既弱，復無印記，
蓋後人妄以松年有曾進《耕織圖》之事，從而傅會之，而未加深考，致以訛傳訛耳。至《
耕圖》『紹興』小璽，則又作偽者不知棨為元時人，誤添蛇足矣。又考兩卷題跋，姚式而
外諸人，皆每卷分題，則二卷在當時本相屬附，後乃分佚單行，故《耕圖》有項元汴收藏
諸印記，而《織圖》則無，可以驗其離合之由矣。今既為延津之合，因命同篋襲弆，置諸
御園多稼軒。軒之北為貴織山堂，皆皇考御額，所以重農桑，而示後世也。昔皇祖題《耕
織圖》泐板行世。今得此佳蹟合并，且有關重民衣食之本，亦將勒之貞石，以示家法於有
永。因考其源委，並識兩卷中，兼用璹韻題圖隙。至原書及偽款，仍存其舊，蓋所重在訂
證覈實前此之誤，固不必為之文飾，亦瑕瑜不揜之道也。已丑上元後六日，御筆。
Previously Jiang Pu [1708–1761] presented this picture [to the throne] and [wrote] a preface at the
beginning of the scroll identifying it as a work by Liu Songnian [ca. 1150–after 1225], which
indeed has already been entered in the Shiqu baoji [catalogue of the imperial collection].3 Now We
have acquired [Liu] Songnian’s Tilling Rice, and its brushwork is observably quite similar to this scroll. Upon further comparison of the two scrolls, the dimensions of their paper as well as the
styles of both their painting and seal script [inscriptions] are entirely identical. At the end of the
Tilling scroll, the colophon by Yao Shi [died between 1314–20] says, ―[Cheng] Qi, [courtesy
name] Yifu, who was the great-grandson of Duke Cheng Wenjian [Cheng Lin, 988–1056],4 painted
[the illustrations] for the two scrolls Tilling and Weaving and [wrote out the poems] in seal script,‖
while at the end of the Weaving scroll, the colophon by Zhao Zijun [see below, colophon 1] says,
―each passage of seal script was written by the hand of Suizhai.‖ Now, as the paper joins
[between the last illustration and first colophon] of each scroll bear [impressions of the same] two
seals reading Yifu and Suizhai, there can be no doubt that it was Cheng Qi, who made [these] copies
after Lou Shou’s compositions and wrote out the poems. Upon closely examining the threecharacter [artist signatures] on both paintings, reading ―brushed by [Liu] Songnian,‖ [one finds
that] the writing is quite weak and as there are none of [Liu’s] seal impressions, it is probable that
some later person— without making any deeper investigation [of the facts]—fallaciously added
[the signatures] to accord with the story that [Liu] Songnian had once presented the paintings
Tilling and Weaving [to the throne], thus perpetuating one falsehood through another. As for the
small [Song dynasty] imperial seal reading Shaoxing that appears on Tilling, this was also
[impressed] because the forger [of the seal] did not know that [Cheng] Qi was a man of the Yuan
dynasty, and so he erroneously ―added feet to the snake.‖ On further investigating the colophons
[that appear] on the two scrolls, all of the writers except Yao Shi separately inscribed each [scroll],
so [it is clear that] the two scrolls were together at some point, but later became separated and
circulated individually, which can be verified by [the fact that] Tilling bears numerous collector
seals of Xiang Yuanbian, while Weaving has none. As the two scrolls have now been [miraculously
reunited as the two swords] at Yan Ford, We have ordered that they be kept together in the same
box, and have placed them in the Duojia Pavilion in the imperial garden [of the Yuanmingyuan
palace]. North of the pavilion is Guizhi Mountain Hall, for which Our Late August Father [Emperor Yongzheng] personally provided the name tablets, so as to emphasize agriculture and
sericulture and proclaim [their importance] to later generations. In the past, Our Late August
Grandfather [Emperor Kangxi] inscribed [a set of poems] for the Pictures of Tilling and Weaving,
woodblock prints of which are current in the world. Now We have been able to reunite these [two]
beautiful works, and as they concern the fundamentals of clothing and food for the common
people, We shall also have them engraved on stone, thereby proclaiming Our Family Regulations
for eternity. Accordingly, we have investigated [their history] from beginning to end and written
it on both scrolls, and have [composed a set of poems] using [Lou] Shou’s rhymes to inscribe in
open spaces among the pictures. As to the original texts and fake signatures, We shall preserve
them as of old, for what is important is to examine the evidence and establish the facts [so as to
correct] earlier mistakes, and while one must certainly not gloss them over, it is also a way to not
allow such defects to obscure the excellence [of these paintings]. On the sixth day after shangyuan
[fifteenth day of the first lunar month] in the yichou year [February 27, 1769], written by the
Emperor.

Once long ago when I was serving temporarily in the Jade Hall [Hanlin Academy], I was invited
to speak about the Illustrations of the Odes of Bin.
46 So I assuredly know that when the Master of
the fields abandoned his office and presented a handful of grain to feed the people, encouraged
them to trade and engage in financial transactions and to exchange their accumulated stores, it was
not only in the era of Yu [Shun] and Xia [Yu] that ―all the nations were ably governed,‖ but for a
million years people’s lives have depended on it.47…One day Xunzhai was sitting in my country

Zhang Kan『張戡』(square relief) – lower right corner we toured Daoshan Hall, passed through the Hanqing Studio, ascended the Armillary
Sphere Terrace, where we inspected the armillaries, walked along the Jade
Canal, and ascended the Library Pavilion. Lining the pavilion on both sides are a succession of
alcoves where calligraphy and paintings by emperors of former dynasties are kept. In addition,
there are more than fifty large red-lacquered chests [containing] model calligraphy and famous
paintings from antiquity to the present, of which we were able to peruse only Autumn, Winter,
Harvest, and Storehouse [sections 21 to 24].3 All the [scrolls] within [the chests] are decorated
with magpie-pattern silks and ivory rollerknobs, while gold-figured silk has been added to those
that bear imperial inscriptions. On both the outside and inside of each scroll is the seal of the
imperial secretariat
[shangshusheng yin].”
This painting shows a sturdy warrior who has removed his armor and sits at rest
inspecting his arrows, while beside him rolls a horse kicking mightily, and all around them
only traces of desert. While there remains but one seal of the painter Zhang Kan in the
[lower] right corner, in the upper right corner is the seal of the imperial secretariat, the
vermilion color of which is [still] quite bright. Could this be one of the only [paintings] to
survive until the present from the large red-lacquered chests [once] kept in the imperial
library? I saw this scroll in a painting and calligraphy store when I returned [home] to the
south during the gengwu year in the Jiaqing reign period [1810], but it was not until more
than ten years later, in the fourth lunar month of the yiyou year in the Daoguang reign
period [May18–June 16, 1825] that I acquired it. Linghai is remote and far-removed, and
has no true connoisseurs [of painting and calligraphy], still I congratulate myself that it
was no mere accident that I was fated to acquire this work.4 Recorded in my
Yunqingguan [studio] on the sixteenth day in the fourth lunar month of the xinchou year
[June 5, 1841]. On the right side [sic!] of the scroll are seal impressions of prime minister
Liang Jiaolin [Liang Qingbiao], and the ivory roller-knobs have been around for several
hundred years, which overwhelms me with nostalgia [for the past]. The yihai year [1075] mentioned in the [Zhou Mi] record above was the first year in the Deyou reign period of
Emperor [Zhao] Xian, when Gongjin [Zhou Mi] was in his forty-fourth year.5

此老在泰和間，猶入直于祕書監。予始識之，時年幾八十矣，而精力不少衰。每于屋壁間
喜作大樹石，退而睨之，乃自歎曰：『今老矣，始解作畫！』。非真積力久，功夫至到，
其融渾成就處，斷未易省識。今觀此《風雪杉松圖》，其精緻如此。至敹年自負其能，亦

During the Taihe reign period [1201–09], this old fellow [Li Shan] was still serving as Director of
the Palace Library, and though he was indeed nearly eighty when I first made his acquaintance, 
his energy had not diminished in the slightest. Whenever he felt happy about some mural he had
painted of great trees and rocks, he would step back and squint at it, then sigh to himself saying,
―Now that I’m old, I’m beginning to understand how to paint!‖ Had he truly not built up his
strength for a long time and attained such a level of proficiency, his harmonious achievement
certainly would not be so easy to know. Now the skill and finesse one sees in Wind and Snow in
the Fir-pines are like this. But while it is no fault for someone late in years to trust in his own
ability, can anyone in the mundane world truly understand him? Therefore when my deceased
father [Wang Tingyun, who was a member of ] the Hanlin Academy, wrote out the poem by
some earlier person as an appraisal [of Li’s character], it must have been to place the old fellow
on the same ground as the ancient masters. Reading at it, as they say, ―makes one feel more
deeply.‖ Twenty-second day in the sixth lunar-month of the guimao year [July 10, 1243],

At right is the picture Wind and Snow in the Fir-pines painted by Li Shan, Director of the Palace
Library during the Jin dynasty. Following it Old Man Yellow Flower, Wang Tingyun, inscribed a
poem by Canliao [see Colophon 1]. Both gentlemen were descendents of famous Song-dynasty
families and were renowned courtiers close to the [imperial] Wanyan clan. I have casually
composed two quatrains to inscribe at the end [of the scroll], as follows: [poems not translated].5
If the two gentlemen [Li and Wang] were here today, I’d not be able to stop perspiring [from
embarassment]. For Li’s brushwork is free and easy, exceptionally clear and fine, and goes
outside the normal path, while [Wang] Tingyun’s [calligraphy] is smooth and elegant, and
achieves the samadhi [full realization] of Haiyue’an [Mi Fu, 1051–1107]. Both [works] can be
treasured. The [latter] gentleman was barely in his forty-seventh year when he died, yet he
always referred to himself as Old Man Yellow Flower, which is extremely funny. At the end of
the [second] colophon, the person who calls himself Wanqing attained the rank of Bureau
Director of the Right Office in the Branch Secretariat. The History of the Jin Dynasty mistakenly
writes [his name as] Manqing, so one should use the [signature] here to correct [this error].6

升屬前翰林侍讀王文治補書。時乾隆五十一年夏孟九日。
On the sixth day of the first spring month in the twenty-eighth year of the Qianlong reign-period
[February 18, 1763], the August Emperor rode to the Chonghua Palace and summoned court
ministers, altogether twenty-four in number, to be given a banquet, and I your subject [Peng]
Qifeng, received the Imperial Favor to be among them. After a while, His Majesty composed two
stanzas of regulated verse and commanded His ministers and others [to create] matching poems,
and He also made a special gift to each [of the twenty-four courtiers] of a scroll from the Imperial
Household Collection painted by a famous artist. I your subject [Peng] Qifeng received Wind and
Snow in the Fir-pines, bowing my head respectfully to accept [the scroll]. After the banquet, I took it back to my official residence and rolled out the picture to examine it. [The painting] was
done on silk by Li Shan, the Director of the Palace Library during the Taihe reign period [1201–
09] of the Jin dynasty. There are a total of eleven fir-pines large and small, and ranges of peaks in
serried ranks, unclear and indistinct with a cold and freezing look. The thatched hut is desolate
and bare, and there is a person [inside] grasping the table and holding a scroll. In front of the hall,
a stand of trees towers up, with straight trunks and lofty branches lifting into the snowy wind.
They cannot be cowed or made to bend, and stay luxuriantly green [throughout the winter
season] of the Primal Yin, seeming to lean over and shelter what lies below. As the Jin dynasty
was not very long after the [Northern] Song, the texture strokes and use of [ink] wash on the trees
and stones were influenced by the styles of Song-dynasty artists. Following [the painting] is a
poem of Canliao [11th century] written out by the True Recluse of Yellow Flower [Mountain],
Wang Tingyun. The colophon by Wang Shizhen of the Ming dynasty [see Colophon 3, above]
praises his calligraphy [by stating that] his style of brushwork directly entered the chamber of
Haiyue
[Mi Fu, 1051–1107]. Yellow Flower’s son, [Wang] Wanqing, added a further inscription to [the
scroll]. The manuscript by the Mountain Man of Yanzhou [Wang Shizhen] says that in this scroll
Li Shan’s ―brushwork is free and easy, and goes outside the normal path.‖ All this being so, then
from the [imperial] Wanyan clan [of the Jin dynasty] on down, this picture has been relished by
famous worthies for several hundred years. I humbly read the quatrain in seven-character lines
composed by His Majesty, and its thought is profound and eternal. The brushwork is effortless
and untrammeled, the round [strokes are done] with spirit and the square with intelligence, each
one specially forged and tempered. This scroll is worthy indeed of immortality! During the
winter, when I your subject [Peng] Qifeng was in residence [at court], I received the Imperial
Command promoting me to Left Censor-in-Chief. The Celestial Certificate descended, sternly
enjoining me to maintain the moral integrity [of the pine], which is the last to wither [in winter].
As the Dispensation of the August Throne caused [me], this inferior timber of ailanthus and
chestnut oak, to receive [the benefits of] rain and dew and shall forever safeguard their days,
averting all harm from axe and hatchet, I was truly overwhelmed by [the Emperor’s] Generosity
and Kindness. He had the [scroll’s] fastening pin of green jade carved with eleven characters in
clerical script [reading], “Wind and Snow in the Fir-pines, by Li Shan; [with] a poem by His
Majesty Qianlong.‖ His seals [on the painting] read: Shiqu baoji, Sanxitang jingjian xi, Qianlong
yulan zhi bao, Yi zisun, De jiaqu, Jixia yiqing, Qianlong jianshang, Zhenmi,13 and Zisun bao zhi.
[The scroll also] has earlier [seals reading]: Pingyang, Qiankun qingshang, You Ming Wang shi
tushu zhi yin, Jiangbiao Huang Lin, Xiubo, An Yizhou jiazhencang, Liang Qingbiao yin, Jiaolin
jianding, Jiaolin miwan, Dingyuan,14Zhongya, Gu Jiude,15Yan Ze, and Zhang Yujun.
16 I have not
transcribed the collector seals on the [colophon] section behind [the painting]. The
sevencharacter [text] on the inside label slip in front [of the painting] must have been written by
Wang Zhideng [1535–1612] of the Ming dynasty. Respectfully recorded by the Metropolitan
Graduate with Honors, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, and Left Censor-in-Chief of the
Surveillance Bureau, on duty in the Southern Study, your subject Peng Qifeng.
The scroll Wind and Snow in the Fir-pines, by Li Shan of the Jin dynasty, was bestowed by His
Majesty on the Commander-in-chief, Lord Peng,17 who respectfully recorded [the event] from
beginning to end, but did not get around to writing it [on the scroll] himself. As the Lord recently
passed away, his son [Peng] Shaosheng [1740–1796] instructed me, the former Reader-inwaiting
in the Hanlin Academy, Wang Wenzhi, to add his text [to the scroll]. It is the ninth day in the
fourth lunar-month of the fifty-first year in the Qianlong reign period [May 6, 1786].

Li Shan held the rank of Director of Palace Library, and throughout his life was fond of making
pictures of wind and snow in the firs and pines.3 ―His brushwork was free and natural‖ and the
spiritual resonance [of his paintings] was simple and bold, ―achieving a most refined effect,‖
while his ink was heavily saturated and ―went beyond the narrow path.‖4 His intent lay
somewhere between Guo Xi [1001–1090] and Dong Beiyuan [Dong Yuan, died 960]. [Titled]

丙辰秋七月上瀚，偶過蘭翁齋中，出示此畫属題。余觀畫譜，李山同名者有三 : 唐李山、
有金李山、康熙間李山，善指畫。此幅墨氣塵厚，用筆瀟灑，非金李山所能到也。余評此
畫有唐時風味，定為唐李山是也。蘭舟先生以為如何？審定並請雅教，徐璘又識。
During the first decade of the seventh lunar-month in the bingchen year [August 1–10, 1856],5
I
happened to visit the studio of Old Lan [unidentified], who brought out this painting and
requested a colophon. I have looked through the registers of painters and there are three who
share the name Li Shan: a Li Shan from the Tang dynasty, a Li Shan from the Jin dynasty, and a
Li Shan from the Kangxi reign period, who was skilled at painting with his fingers. The ink of
this painting is deep and thick6 while the brushwork is free and natural, which is not something
that Li Shan of the Jin dynasty could have achieved. In my opinion the painting has the style and
flavor of the Tang, so I conclude that it is by Li Shan of the Tang dynasty. What does Mister
Lanzhou think about this? Authenticated and requesting your graceful instruction, inscribed again
by Xu Lin.

近山嵯峨屋上攢，遠山縹緲煙中蟠，展圖初訝河陽李，諦玩始知為范寬。
天空木淨秋堪掬，沙上流泉清似玉，地僻雖云履跡稀，細路通川仍貫麓，
老松蔭溪風滿裾，有客投竿方釣魚，得魚與否且不計，寧似人間防毀譽，
隔溪臺閣山頭踞，其中大好棲遲處，如何寂寂無人遊，付与雲霞自來去。
不見解衣槃礡時，摩挲但賞無聲詩，水墨之工逾五綵，天機所到誰能迨
深重吾知類右丞，巧密人言過王宰。濃淡位置種種良，一望溪山如許長，

雲山崷崪青蒼攢，霜木夭矯蛟龍蟠，不知落筆者誰子，只尺忽驚千里寬。
澄江如練宛可掬，水石冷冷映寒玉，絕壁委蛇細路斜，兩兩漁家住山麓，
丈人沙上古冠裾，直釣所適不取魚，神超元氣希夷外，卻笑嚴陵猶釣譽，
同流傲世亦多踞，扁舟來往煙深處，舉網時得淞江鱸，鼓枻悠然浩歌去。
鄭虔祁岳今幾時，入眥彷彿王維詩，並時馬夏亦工綵，范子神逸不可迨，
直與造化爭秋毫，恐泄元機泣真宰。嗚呼鑒賞誰最良，放翁眼力千丈長，
撫啚我有卜居意，須趂中年身為強。嘉靖壬午長至日，蜀張鵬書。
[Lines 12–15, translation below; translation of remainder forthcoming]
The old man sitting on the sand wears an ancient cap and gown,
What his straightened hook is suited for is not catching fish;
His spirit has transcended all that one can normally perceive,
He laughs instead at Yan Ling, who was angling still for fame.3

南方多山如戟攢，奇形異狀相屈蟠，路縈陡壁人不到，家住平溪天漸寬。
生綃一幅未盈掬，千里芙蓉削繁玉，澹澹烟波動小舠，依依竹樹圍深麓，
磯上高人坐斂裾，伊人釣事總忘魚，清風明月一竿竹，不與浮世爭名譽，
精廬遙望何高踞，正在雲霞最深處，但見松梧繞檻聲，不知日月隨波去。
所愛物色清秋時，一水一石各可詩，丹青似覺多華綵，一筆天然安可迨，
意者人如海上公，或言事是山中宰。海內水墨稱林良，翎毛之外非所長，

Zhongli Quan Seeking the Dao is without doubt a genuine work by Hongguzi [Jing Hao].
Someone in the past praised [his painting] as ―absolutely exceptional in structure and
composition, while the thought put into it is lofty and profound,‖1
[qualities] that are entirely
present in this work. The text written by Xiangguang [Dong Qichang] and the personal seals of
Jiaolin [Liang Qingbiao] are both quite authentic. I recently sent [the painting] to Junior Steward 
Qian2
and he too could not help but sigh in appreciation. Allow me to tell you all about it the next
time we meet, but I am writing specifically to deliver [the painting] with my respects, and inquire
as to your honor’s well-being. Addressed with unending admiration for the great man, my eighth

brother and old family friend, Zou Bingtai.

With the strangeness of its central peak and the antique [manner] of its figures and vegetation,
this picture is truly as premier Xiaoping [Zou Bingtai] stated, it is ―absolutely exceptional in
structure and composition, and the thought put into it is lofty and profound,‖ and since it was also 
authenticated by Siweng [Dong Qichang] and Jiaolin [Liang Qingbiao], what further doubt could
there be [as to its attribution ot Jing Hao]! In my humble opinion, the brushwork of the ancients is
all about strength, while the style [of the individual calligrapher] is contained in the two ends of
[each] brush stroke; if one does not seek the style [of a work] stroke by stroke and only looks at
the larger design, one will not [arrive at a] true understanding of it. The premier was a patron and
teacher of my father, Wenque [Chen Guanjun, active 1808–1849],3
and Zhupeng [Li Zuoxian,
1807–1876] and Jiyun [Li Enqing, active 1833–after 1864] were protégées of my late father,
while I was a student of Aiwulu [Li Enqing] and am a relative by marriage to Shiquan zhuren [Li
Zuoxian], so from first to last it has indeed been my great good fortune to view the painting [on
many occasions]. Inscribed by Haibin bingshi, Chen Jieqi, on gengchen, the tenth day of the
eighth lunar-month in the jiaxu year of the Tongzhi reign period [September 20, 1874].

道人記。
The great masters of the Tang and Song dynasties—Jing [Hao], Guan [Tong, active early 10th
century], Dong [Yuan, died 960], and Ju[ran, active late 10th century]—never signed their works.
So all their famous masterpieces that have come down through the ages were attributed to them
by experts and connoisseurs. In particular, Mi Xiangyang [Mi Fu, 1151–1107] of the Song
dynasty and Dong Huating [Dong Qichang, 1555–1636] of the Ming dynasty were the most
prolific and substantive in their connoisseurship, probably because their collections and viewing
experiences were the most extrensive and vast, and they were also so well-versed in each artist’s
painting style, and had such a deep understanding of each tradition, that they could establish the
authenticity of a work by any of these four [artists] at a single glance. Xiangguang [Dong
Qichang] especially tadmired and emulated these four artists and Li Cheng [919–967]; see [the
relevant passage in] the Nigu lu.
6 Zhang Chou [1577–1643] also recorded that he collected [Jing]
Hao’s Precipitous Peaks scroll, therefore [he was fully qualified] to validate the authenticity [of
this painting].7 Zou Bingtai believed that the words of [Dong Qichang’s] inscription were not just
offhand. Bingtai was an art connoisseur from Wuxi, who served as Grand Secretary, and I suspect
that the Yaozhai [to whom he wrote his letter] was the shaozongbo Zhang Tingzan of
Tongcheng.8 This scroll probably underwent remounting by him, cutting off [the sections of]
original silk bearing Dong’s colophon and Liang’s seals and setting them together with Zou’s
letter into the new [mounting] silk. From the end of the Tang until today, more than a thousand
years have passed, and extremely few of [Jing] Hao’s works are recorded in the catalogues of
famous collectors. Although the silk of this scroll is quite worn, [the qualities of] the brushwork
and ink can still be discerned, so it would not be at all excessive [to call it] a divine thing. 
Inscribed again after recording the catalogue entries of [the two] Lis and Dai [Xi], on the evening
of shangyuan [the 15th day] in the first lunar month of the first year in the Xuantong reign period
[February 5, 1909]. Recorded by Se Daoren.

Autumn Moon on Dongting Lake
Oranges fragrant, from every shore green and yellow emerge,
I moor my boat at dusk beside a shack of sticks and thorns.
Mid surging waves, the lovely moon is like a winsome maid,
Who playfully seems to vaunt her graceful feminine charms. 
In the deep of night when no clouds obscure the Milky Way,
Lofty winds then skim the surface, ruffling its whiteness.
Five o’clock and, somewhere off, a painted horn is blowing,
When I am dressed and go to look, the golden bowl has sunk.

此卷《長江萬里圖》為今大參張夏山先生所藏。予嘗於京口見米元章澄心堂紙一卷，筆勢
奇怪，有意外象。家居時，吳人持至一卷夏圭，墨氣古勁可愛。此卷則規模郭熙，而帄遠
清潤，有不盡之趣。宋室倚長江為湯池，故當時畫手多喜為之，卒不能守，而鐵騎飛渡矣
，乃相與為之浩歎。夏山字用載，家金華，山中景物絕勝，而宦囊半貯此物，將所謂行住
坐臥，不離這箇耶？復相與為之大笑。是歲嘉靖甲午八月吉，觀於江西布政司之紫薇樓下

This handscroll, Ten Thousand Li Along the Yangzi River, is in the collection of the
Adminstration Vice Commissioner, Mister Zhang Xiashan.9
In Jingkou, I once saw a handscroll
[painting of the Yangzi River] by Mi Yuanzhang [Mi Fu, 1051–1107] done on chengxintang
paper.10 Its brushwork was strange and unusual, and it had an appearance beyond one’s
imagination. And when I was staying at home [in Zhejiang], a man from Wu [Suzhou] once
brought a handscroll [painting of the Yangzi River] by Xia Gui [first-half 13th century], and I
loved the antique power of its ink tonalities. This handscroll, however, is modeled on Guo Xi [ca.
1001–1090]. Its level distances are clear and moist, and it has a feeling of infinite space. The
[imperial] House of Song relied on the Yangzi River as an impregnable moat, so many artists of
the time liked to paint it. But in the end, [the river] could not protect them and the iron cavalry [of
the Mongols] came flying right across. Because of this, we both heaved an enormous sigh.
Xiashan’s courtesy name is Yongzai and his home is in Jinhua [Zhejiang Province], where the
mountain scenery is extraordinary. This thing takes up half the space in his official pouch, [so I
asked if] it is one of those possessions, as they say, ―from which one never parts, whether
moving or staying, sitting or lying down?‖ Because of this we both had a great laugh. On this the
first day of the eighth lunar month in the jiawu year of the Jiajing reign period [September 8,
1534], written on viewing [the painting] in the Crape Myrtle Pavilion at the Jiangxi Provincial
Administration Commission [in Nanchang], Lu Shen, Ziyuan fu, from Yunjian.11

具在，定為北宋以前名手，非馬、夏輩所能比肩。後有吾鄉陸文裕題跋，書法秀整，足與
畫為二絕，殊可寶也。己未中秋後五日，董其昌題。
I once saw a Yangzi River painting by Li Boshi [Li Gonglin, ca. 1049–1106] in the collection of
[vice minister of] the Imperial Stud, Chen Ziyou [1543–1626], and it had exceptionally fine
brushwork.12 On looking now at this handscroll, [I see that] it was in the [Northern Song] imperial
collection during the Xuanhe reign period [1119–25] and still bears all of the small imperial seals;
it is certainly not a work with which the likes of Ma Yuan [late 12th–early 13th century] or Xia Gui [active first half 13th century] could compete. At the end [of the scroll], there is a colophon
written by Lu Wenyu [Lu Shen] from my home district. Both it and the painting are a pair of
exceptional works and should be especially treasured. Fifth day after mid-autumn in the jiwei year
[September 27, 1619], inscribed by Dong Qichang.

Extending over the length of Li Gonglin’s The Shu River is a landscape of ten-thousand li that
[lets the viewer] completely transcend the marks left by brush and ink and roam at large with the
Creator. In the inscription by Dong Wenmin [Dong Qichang, 1555–1636] on Gonglin’s XiaoXiang
River, he states that [it and] this scroll, together with the Nine Songs, and the Admonitions of the
Instructress by Gu Kaizhi [ca. 345–406], were the [four] best among the famous scrolls collected
by Gu [Congyi, 1523–1588] of the Secreatriat.6 After him, [the painting] circulated and was
passed around as set forth in detail in the colophons by Chen Suoyun and others [see below].
In Dong [Qichang’s] colophon, he refers to General Wang Siyan’s acquisition of the scroll as a
―homecoming.‖ As all [four of Gu Congyi’s paintings] have now entered Our private collection,
how can that previous ―homecoming‖ [of two scrolls] compare to this? What a pity that We
cannot bring Xiangguang [Dong Qichang] back to life and command him rewrite his statement.

Hard is the Road to Shu, using the rhymes of Li Bai.
15 [Poem not translated.]
From reading [Li] Taibai’s poem, We previously had the idea that the road to Shu [Sichuan] was
the most perilous territory known to man, but in the last couple of years We have employed Our
military in the Jinchuan [region of western Sichuan], where the terrain is so much more perilous
[than in the poem] that one looks back upon the ―sky ladders‖ of Sword Gate [Pass] as just a
smooth and level path. From reports to the throne [sent] by Assistant Grand Secretary, the Loyal
and Brave Duke, Fuheng, We formed an overall impression [of its topography], and fêting him
upon his triumphant return, We commanded him to describe it all in minute detail, [which he did
so realistically] that it felt as if We had personally undertaken [the journey], and immediately
[made the above poem] using the rhymes of [Li] Bai to record it.16 If [Li] Bai were to read this,
he would suddenly feel as if he had never witnessed any hardships at all on the road to Shu. As
We were just now looking over this picture by Longmian [Li Gonglin], We forthwith recorded
Our poem upon it. Although all the sites along the River of Ba [Sichuan] are labeled in order on
the scroll, it does not reach to the steep and hidden places beyond the border [where the recent
campaign took place]. What a pity We cannot bring Longmian back to life to add a depiction of
Our poem! Five days after changzhi [summer solstice] in the jisi year of the Qianlong reign

While the painting by Longmian [Li Gonglin] is indeed meticulously rendered, I am especially
enamored of his miniature ―fly’s head‖ calligraphy. As one unrolls the scroll, all along its length
[are short texts] written in the style of script used for placards and signboards, from which one
understands what is meant by ―writing small calligraphy just like large calligraphy.‖ Some say
that this is the brushwork of Mi Yuanzhang [Mi Fu, 1042–1107]; however, the Record [of
calligraphy in the imperial collection, compiled during the] Xuanhe Era praises the calligraphy of
Boshi [Li Gonglin] as being close to that of the Wei and Jin dynasties [220–420], so why must
the calligraphy that Boshi inscribed on paintings routinely be attributed to Haiyue [Mi Fu]?

The two colophons by Dong Xiangguang [Dong Qichang, see Colophons 1 and 4] are bright and
sleek and have a glowing look, so they were obviously treasured. Gao Shiqi [see Colophons 6
and 8] says that they were lost at first and later recovered, and that ―in the spring of the wuyin
year [1698], [he] had them mounted at the end [of the painting].‖ And he also says that in looking
[at the painting], ―it does in fact bear the seal impressions of a Wang Yanshi,‖ and ―the small
seal [reading] Yongcun zhenmi is located on the paper joins.‖ In looking now at these two seals,
as they are impressed exactly on the join [between the painting] and Dong’s [first] colophon,
how can Gao say that they were lost and recovered and that he had them remounted?18 In winter
of the xinyin year [1751], when We unrolled the scroll again and read through the two colophons
by [Gao] Shiqi, We had doubts that there is any substance [to his claims], and have therefore
casually written this. On the first day of the tenth lunar-month [November 18], inscribed by the

The former collection of Warden Gu Ruhe [Gu Congyi, 1523–1588] included two pictures by Li
Longmian [L Gonglin], The Xiao-Xiang River and The Shu River, both of which are praised as
works of the divine class. The Xiao-Xiang River reverted to me, and I exchanged it with Wu Ting,
[courtesy-name] Yongqing, for an ancient bronze tripod, which I have not been able to stop
regretting to this day. I do not know into whose hands The Shu River initially fell, but it circulated
around, being sold and resold, until it too reverted to Yongqing [see Collector Seals 3, below].

In the spring of the jiaxu year [1694], I acquired Dream Journey on the Xiao-Xiang River and,
combining it with the present scroll, I happily composed a long song and inscribed it at the end
[see Colophon 8]. In the ninth lunar-month of that year, I received an imperial command to go
north, and I spent [the next] three years in the capital, half the time on campaign beyond the
frontier.22 In the ninth lunar-month of the dingchou year [October 15–November 13, 1697], I
requested leave and returned home to the south, opening and viewing [this scroll] for the first
time aboard the boat. In the tenth lunar-month, when I arrived at the Gate of Wu [Suzhou], I met
Gu Weiyue, who told me, ―Traveling this summer in Hanjiang [modern Yangzhou], I acquired
the frontispiece and colophon [sections] of The Shu River. And having bought them for you, I
have waited to attend on you.‖ So I gladly asked to see [the texts], and the two [above] colophons
by Dong Wenmin [Dong Qichang] were among them. In spring of the wuyin year [1698], I had
the [colophons] mounted to the end [of the painting] and, though I again wanted to compose a
poem to commemorate the occasion, I held back out of circumspection. On a frosty morning at
the beginning of the tenth lunar-month in the jimao year [late November 1699], the
chrysanthemums by the hedge are still fragrant, and as I happened to recall [these events], fearing
that this fine story might be forever lost, I have recorded it at the end of the scroll. If not for
divine protection, how could these colophons be separated [from the painting] for some thirty or
forty years, and later come to be made whole? [The course of] human lives [fluctuates] between
heaven and earth, and time after time our meetings and partings, separations and reunions, give
cause to sigh. May those who later view [this scroll], please treasure it greatly [that it may]
forever preserve this episode of providential destiny. As for the small standard script on the
painting, it is definitely the writing of Mi [Fu], and the assertion of Wenmin [Dong Qichang, see
Colophon 1] that it was written by Boshi [Li Gonglin] does not show discernment. Shi Laiyi ren,

水，荊關旗鼓詎相當，層巒恠樹盡幽趣，膾炙口頰稱山莊。蜀江圖卷亦奇作，岷山汶嶺爭仾
昂，澦東巴峽各殊狀，橫源魏沱看淼茫。上廵下廵灘十六，赤甲白鹽臨瞿塘，飛甍特寫武侯
廟，磧餘八陣臺基荒。叢祠野亭並蕭寺，點綴一一窮毫芒，萬里橋西工部宅，浣花溪水澄滄
浪。嶾嶙入漢插玉壘，巍峩古觀存青羊，韶日欲尋芳草渡，春芹擬取青泥坊。
頓使至者得道路，溪瀨如聞花藥香，蠅頭細楷法遒勁，山名 24水號注且詳。
何年跋語被割棄，妙蹟無人能表張，久置塵櫝不經意，二十餘年埋夜光。江南人家偶搜訪，
又有遺墨傳瀟湘，華亭博雅鑒審確，言與蜀江為雁行。急檢籤帙出觀覽，印記果是將軍藏，
氣韻生動筆宕滌，佳紙細辨澄心堂。千里勝境咫尺內，臥遊從玆老可忘，性同鱗羽愛丘壑，
慵操桂檝驅鸁綱。軒窗茗椀頗不俗，白日暗覺閒中長，朝歷巫峽暮潭沅，吾與二圖終徜徉。
[下註]: 刪『嶾嶙』二句。
龍眠《蜀江圖》，藏我家二十餘年，習於聞見，兼失去題跋，不知重也。近得其《瀟湘臥遊
圖》，有董文敏跋云，『海上顧中舍所藏名卷有四，謂顧愷之《女史箴》，李伯時《蜀江圖
》，《九歌圖》，及此《瀟湘圖》耳。《女史》在檇李項家，《九歌》在余家，《瀟湘圖》
在陳子有參政家，《蜀江圖》在信陽王思延將軍家，皆奇踪也』。因取《蜀江圖》觀之，果
有王延世圖記，即文敏所云王思延。又合縫處『永存珎秘』小印，二卷皆有，當是顧中舍者
。往在京師，見龍眠《山莊圖》，一丘一壑，皆細楷書名，與《蜀江圖》正相類。年來夢想
《山莊圖》，竟不可得。今觀二卷，《蜀江》則江山層疊，纖悉不遺，雖用董巨法，尤饒幽
秀。《瀟湘圖》則脫略生奇，彷徂二米，而林麓映帶，却又不為模糊蒙董之狀。余自匹侶亡
來，百念灰冷，閒居屏跡，惟文籍图史自娛。既得《瀟湘圖》，後得考証《蜀江圖》，不勝
欣快，為賦長句。康熙三十三年甲戌二月三日，積陰新晴，餘寒未減，盆中古榦，紅梅大放
，幽蘭布香。書於簡靜齋，江村高士奇。
[後註]: 《瀟湘圖》亦有王延世印記，或二卷原在王處也。
[Poem not translated.] As The Shu River by Longmian [Li Gonglin, ca. 1049–1106] has been in
my collection for more than twenty years, I am generally familiar with it, but because it was
missing its colophons, I did not realize how important it is. Recently I acquired the Dream
Journey on the Xiao-Xiang River, which bears a colophon by Dong Wenmin [Dong Qichang, 1555–
1636] that says: ―Secretary Gu [Congyi] of Shanghai had four famous handscrolls in his collection,
namely the Admonitions of the Instructress by Gu Kaizhi [ca. 345–406], The Shu River and Nine
Songs by Li Boshi [Li Gonglin], and this picture The Xiao-Xiang River. The Admonitions is in the collection Xiang [Yuanbian, 1525–1590] of Zuili, the Nine Songs is in my
collection, the Xiao-Xiang River is in the collection of Vice Commissioner Chen Ziyou [Chen
Suoyun, 1543–1626], and The Shu River is in the collection of General Wang Siyan [Wang
Yanshi, late 16th–early 17th century] of Yangxin, and they are all rare masterpieces.‖ Looking at
The Shu River with this [colophon in mind], as it does in fact bear the seal impressions of a Wang
Yanshi, he must then be [the person] that Wenmin [Dong Qichang] calls Wang Siyan. Also, the
small seal [reading] Yongcun zhenmi that is impressed on the paper joins of both scrolls must be
that of Secreatary Gu [Congyi]. When I was previously in the capital, I saw the painting Mountain
Villa by Longmian [Li Gonglin], on which the names of every hill and gully are written in
miniature standard script just as on The Shu River. … On the third day of the second lunar-month
in jiaxu, thirty-third year of the Kangxi reign period [February 26, 1694]…written in the Jianjing
Studio by Jiangcun Gao Shiqi.

I am traveling by boat between Nanyang and Xiazhen [both in southwest Shandong Province],
and the river’s current is swift and clear, for this is where all the waters of the Zou-Yi district
gather. Though the seasons are proceeding in sequence toward the beginning [of a new year],
there is still plenty of autumn color. I unrolled the handscroll of The Shu River by Longmian [Li
Gonglin], and inscribed it again at the end with two quatrains: [poems not translated].

Poem One – (4 columns) 洞庭湖上晚風生，風觸湖心一葉橫，蘭棹穩，草衣輕，只釣鱸魚不
釣名。
Out on Cavern Courtyard Lake, the evening wind is born,
Wind strikes the lake’s heart where a leaf is crossing.
Magnolia oar steady,
Light, his robes of grass,
He only fishes perch fish, and does not fish for fame.3
Poem Two – (4 columns) 重整絲綸欲棹船，江頭明月正明圓，酒缾倒，草花懸，拋却漁竿
踏月眠。
He readjusts his silken line, about to row his boat,
At river’s head just now, the moon is shining bright and round.
Wine jug upside-down,
Hanging in grass and flowers,
He casts aside his fishing rod, treads moonlight in his sleep.
Poem Three – (4 columns) 殘陽浦裏漾魚船，青草湖中欲暮天，看白鳥，下平川，點破瀟湘
萬里煙。
A fishing boat drifts by the shore in fading sunset,
Out on Green Grass Lake, the sky is turning to dusk.
See the white birds
Descending to the the level stream,
Dots that pierce a myriad li of Xiao-Xiang River mist.
Poem Four – (4 columns) 如何小小作絲綸，祗向湖中養一身，任公子，龍伯人，枉釣如山
截海鱗。
Why is his silken line made so very frail and thin?
He only goes into the lake to feed a single person.
The son of the Duke of Ren,
And the giant of the Dragon Earl,
Bent mountain-size hooks and cut up ocean monsters.4
Poem Five – (4 columns)
極浦遙看兩岸斜，碧波微影弄晴霞，孤舟小，去無涯，[阿]那箇汀洲[是]下是家。5
At the utmost end of the creek where the two shores converge, Faint
reflections of rosy clouds play upon the emerald waves.
His lonely craft small,
Gone on the boundless main,
Below which sandy islet does his family home lie?
Poem Six – (4 columns)
雪色□
6鬚一老翁，能將短棹撥長空，微有雨，正無風，宜在五湖煙水中。
Snowy beard and moustache, this venerable oldster Can
take his little oar to stir the vast empyrean.
There’s a tiny bit of rain,
Just now there is no wind,
How fine it is to be on Five Lakes’ misty waters.
Poem Seven – (4 columns) 綠楊灣裏夕陽微，萬里霞光浸落暉，擊棹去，未能歸，驚起沙鷗
撲鹿飛。
In the cove of green willows, evening light is faint,
The glowing sun sinks in a myriad li of rosy clouds.
Striking his oar as he goes,
He cannot yet come home,
Suddenly startled, sand gulls fly off in a whoosh.
Poem Eight – (5 columns) 月移山影照漁船，船載山行月在前，山突兀，月嬋娟，一曲漁歌
山月連。無船。
Moon shifts mountain reflection, illumines a fisherman’s boat,
The boat moves, bearing the mountain, with the moon in front.
Mountain steep and tall,
Moon lovely and alluring,
In a single fisherman’s song, the mountain and moon connect.
No boat. 
Poem Nine – (5 columns)
風攪長江浪攪風，魚龍混雜一川中，藏深浦，繫長松，直待雲收月在[中]
7空。
Wind ruffles the Long River, waves ruffle the wind,
Fish and dragons mix and mingle in the same stream.
Hiding up the deep creek,
Tied to a long-lived pine,
He only waits for clouds to clear, moon in the sky.
Poem Ten – (4 columns) 舴艋為舟力幾多，江頭雲雨半相和，殷勤好，下長波，半夜潮生不
那何。
Little skiff for a boat, what strength does he need?
At the river head, clouds and rain half intermingle.
If he is diligent enough,
Rides the long waves down,
When tides rise at midnight, he will have no worries.
Poem Eleven – (4 columns) 殘霞返照四山明，雲起雲收陰復晴，風脚動，浪頭生，聽取虛
蓬夜雨聲。
Mountains glow in the last fading glimmer of sunset; Clouds
rise, clouds clear, and shadows turn to light.
As the wind moves its feet, 
And waves spring to life,
He hears the sound of night rain on the empty awning.
Poem Twelve – (4 columns) 無端垂釣定潭心，魚大船輕力不任，憂傾側，繫浮沈，事事從
輕不要深。
No cause to drop one’s line in the center of the pool; Fish
are big, the boat light, his strength not enough.
Anxious he’ll capsize,
Concerned to keep afloat,
He goes light in everything and stays away from depth.
Poem Thirteen – (4 columns)
釣得紅鱗拽水開，錦鱗敤較逐鉤來，搖赬尾，噞紅腮，不羨嚴陵坐釣臺。
He’s caught a red-scaled fish, drags it from the water;
Its brocade scales of mottled color follow on the hook.
It shakes its crimson tail,
And puffs its reddish gills;
He does not envy Yan Ling sitting on his fishing ledge.8
Poem Fourteen – (5 columns) 五嶺風光絕四隣，滿川鳧鴈是交親，雲觸岸，浪搖身，青草
煙深不見人。
Wind and light at Five Peaks surpass all else around; Ducks
and geese out on the river are his closest kin.
Clouds beat the shore,
Billows stir and toss;
Mist so deep on Green Grass Lake, people can’t be seen.
Poem Fifteen – (4 columns) 舴艋舟人無姓名，葫蘆提酒樂平生，香稻飯，滑蓴羹，棹月穿
雲任性情。
This boatman in his little skiff has no name at all;
In bottle gourds he takes his wine, lives a life of joy.
Fragrant paddy rice,
Luscious water-mallow soup;
He rows the moonlight, piercing clouds, going as he will.
Poem Sixteen – (4 columns) 桃花波起五湖春，一葉隨風萬里身，釣絲細，香餌均，元來不
是取魚人。
Peach blossom waves rise on Five Lakes in spring, A
single leaf upon the wind, gone ten-thousand li.
His fishing line is thin,
The fragrant bait shared out,
From the start, he was not a man who catches fish.

In the past I was fond of Guan Tong’s [active early 10th century] landscapes, for their clarity and
strength were worthy of affection. As these [traits] originally derived from the painting style of
Jing Hao [late 9th–early 10th century, when I later saw Jing’s painting Fishermen, after an artist of
the Tang, which was very like this in composition, I copied it forthwith and made this scroll. [The
painting] was lost during my wandering about, but seeing it again now, I know that things are meant
to meet at a certain times. One day, Weizhong brought this scroll and commanded me to inscribe it.
Oh, since painting it long ago and inscribing it now, it must be more than a decade. Alas, how sad!
For how can one stay the fleeting light? Twenty-first day in the ninth lunar-month, autumn of
renchen, twelfth year in the Zhizheng reign period [October 29, 1352], written by the
Plum Blossom Daoist [Wu Zhen] in the monk’s dormitory of Compassionate Clouds [Temple] in
Wutang [modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province].

Zhonggui [Wu Zhen] copied Jing Hao’s painting Fishermen, after an artist of the Tang. The power
of his brush strokes is ancient and hoary, while the charm [of the work] is lofty and antique. Though
there is little attention to neatness and refinement, it shows extraordinary character and is endowed
with a spirit resonance that leaves a clear delicate aftertaste, while conveying marvelous ideas
beyond the actual paint. When viewed together with the ancient writing, it is not something that
vulgar eyes are able [to understand]. Gongshou [Yao Shou] appreciates and treasures it dearly.10
A while back, he brought [the painting] along on a visit to my Square Isle Thatched Hut, and as he
left it here for several months, I had a long time to roll it out and enjoy it. Modeling myself after
its style has brought me great joy in my evening years. So I have inscribed a few words and am
respectfully returning [the scroll] to you. Colophon by your old friend Zhang Ning.

following lines by Immortal Po [Su Shi, 1037–1101]:
In the rocky soil of the rugged hills,
I found just this one-inch bud of tea.
Seal it tight and do not idly take it out!
Boil too long and guests will not approve.11

In the handscroll Fishermen, there are six men wearing Tang-style caps: one is sitting with a bare
chest and one foot stretched out, his hand rests on an oar and he is not fishing [#1]; one is standing
and gazing homeward, longing to return [#5]; one has placed his oar crosswise and sits gripping
the boat and looking back [#10]; one has fallen asleep in the hold, with his whole body inside
[#11]; one is just rising from sleep and has half emerged from the cabin [#15]; and one sits fishing
while a child manages the oar in back [#16]. Five are wearing official hats: one who is bare-chested
and stares upward, forgetting all his affairs [#3]; one who is reclining [with his head] pillowed up
high and the cabin windows wide open [#2]; one who is not fishing but sits with his hands in his
sleeves [#14]; and ones who [either] fish while sitting [#4], or kneel while fishing [#13]. There is
one man with a cloth [?] on his head who hasn’t the strength [to pull in] a fish, and is bracing both
legs and lifting his arm to bring in the catch [#12]. There is one man who kneels forward and
paddles, in a hurry to get home [#7]. There is one man with a bare topknot who sits asleep clasping
his paddle and waiting for the moon [to rise] before going home [#9]. And there is one man who
wears a straw hat and is paddling, and moreover has a full beard [#6]. Each man has his own boat,
and only one boat has [a second] person in it to steer. People think [the inscriptions] are a single
set of lyrics by [Zhang] Zhihe, comprised of sixteen stanzas.13 One stanza [#8] has a notation
beside it, which says, ―No boat.‖ Alas! It is not that there is no boat, but simply that the cliffs and trees are blocking it
[from view]. This picture was painted by [the master of] Plum Blossom Hut [Wu Zhen] and the
lyrics were also composed by him, so if there was actually a person where one is not supposed to
be, then how could the lyrics have come from the same hand [as the painter]? Also, never in the
world has such a group as this gone fishing, so are [these poems] in fact anything of which [Zhang]
Zhihe could have spoken? As this scroll is about to go aboard the boat Azure River and Rainbow
Moon,14
I’ll praise it, [saying that] no one but the Plum Novice [Wu Zhen] could have painted it, and no
one but my host Danqiu [Yao Shou] could [grasp both] the ideas in the painting and the imagery
in the poems. Bian [Rong] of the Population Bureau recited Immortal’s Po’s line ―the guests will
not approve,‖ simply because the Shepherd of Paulownia Village [Zhou Ding] was not in his seat.
The Shepherd considers himself no less crazy than [Zhang] Zhihe, but what does Danqiu think
about it? [Written] eight days after Establishing Autumn [August 5, 1477], by Tongcun [Paulownia
Village] Zhou Ding, a guest at the East of the Clouds Studio [of Yao Shou], in my seventy-seventh
year.

In [the field of] painting, Jing [Hao] and Guan [Tong] are like Li [Bai] and Du [Fu] in poetry, whose
[names] hang on people’s lips and have been acclaimed for a thousand years.17 By Guan Tong, I
have managed to see [just one work], which moreover I also collected, namely the painting Cloudy
Woods among Mountains and Streams. As for [attributions to] Jing Hao, I have seen no fewer than
five or six scrolls, all of which were fakes or forgeries. I have always considered it a hateful loss
that, like the unicorn’s horn or the feather of a phoenix, one may not come across [a single genuine
example of his work] in a whole lifetime. But in the winter of the yichou year [1625],
I acquired Wu Zhonggui’s direct copy of Jing Hao’s Fishermen painting, which is bold and strong,
lofty and ancient, with a sense of freedom about it almost like flying. Though one glimpses just a
bit of Honggu’s [Jing Hao’s] grand and vast [original], Mei’an’s [Wu Zhen’s] copy of its
appearance is clean and fresh. How often in my old age shall I have the good fortune to come upon
such a wonder? So I have hastily composed a long poem in order to express the dejection of my
heart. [Poem not translated.] Mankind Day [seventh day of the first lunar-month] in the first year

In the collected [literary] works of Li Junshi [Li Rihua, 1565–1635], there is a colophon for this

Moon, thus the colophon of Zhou Boqi [Zhou Ding] mentions it [see colophon 3, above].‖18 Now
the current scroll has the colophon by Boqi, but does not have the colophon by Junshi, so I suspect
he did not write it on the scroll at the time. Boqi’s colophon says that he was a guest at the East of
the Clouds Studio, which must be Yao Danqiu’s residence. Recorded again on the same day [as

慶歷四年春，滕子京謫守巴陵郡。越明年，政通人和，百廢具興，乃重修岳陽樓，增其舊
製，刻唐賢今人詩賦于其上，屬予作文以記之。予觀夫巴陵勝狀，在洞庭一湖，啣 3遠山
，吞長江，浩浩蕩蕩，橫無際涯，朝暉夕陰，氣象萬千，此則岳陽樓之大觀也。前人之述
備矣。然則北通巫峽，南極瀟湘，遷客騷人，多會於此，覽物之情，得無異乎！若夫霪雨
霏霏，連月不開，陰風怒號，濁浪排空，日星隱耀，山岳潛形，商旅不行，檣傾楫摧，薄
暮冥冥，虎嘯猿啼。登斯樓也，則有去國懷鄉，憂讒畏譏，滿目瀟然，感激而悲者矣。至
若春和景明，波瀾不驚，上下天光，一碧萬頃，沙鷗翔集，錦鱗游泳，岸芷汀蘭，郁郁青
青。而或長煙一空，皓月千里，浮光躍金，靜影沈璧，漁歌互答，此樂何極？登斯樓也，
則有心曠神怡，寵辱皆忘，把酒臨風，其喜洋洋者矣。嗟夫！予嘗求古仁人之心，或異二
者之為，何哉？不以物喜，不以己悲。居廟堂之高，則憂其民；處江湖之遠，則憂其君。
是進亦憂，退亦憂。然則何時而樂耶？其必曰：先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂歟！噫
，微斯仁，吾誰與歸！右岳陽樓記。

Inscription: Literary text, prose and poem (8x7), by Wang Bo 王勃 (ca. 650–ca. 676): Qiuri
deng Hongfu Tengwangge jianbie xu 秋日登洪府滕王閣餞別序 (Preface [to Poems Composed]
On Ascending the Pavilion of the Prince of Teng in Hong Prefecture on an Autumn Day for a
Farewell Feast).2
46 columns, miniature standard script.
南昌故郡，洪都新府，星分翼軫，地接衡廬，襟三江而帶五湖，控蠻荊而引甌越。物華天
寶，龍光射牛斗之墟；人傑地靈，徐孺下陳蕃之榻。雄州霧列，俊彩星馳，臺隍枕夷夏之
交，賓主盡東南之美。都督閻公之雅望，棨戟遙臨；宇文新州之懿範，襜帷暫駐。十旬休
暇，勝友如雲，千里逢迎，高朋滿座。騰蛟起鳳，孟學士之詞宗；紫電清霜，王將軍之武
庫。家君作宰，路出名區，童子何知，躬逢勝餞。時維九月，序屬三秋，潦水盡而寒潭清
，煙光凝而暮山紫。儼驂騑於上路，訪風景於崇阿，臨帝子之長洲，得仙人之舊館。層巒
聳翠，上出重霄，飛閣流丹，下臨無地。鶴汀鳧渚，窮島嶼之縈迴；桂殿蘭宮，列岡巒之
體勢。披繡闥，俯雕甍，山原曠其盈視，川澤盱其駭矚。閭閻撲地，鐘鳴鼎之家；舸艦迷
津，青雀黃龍之軸。虹鎖雨鑓，彩徹雲衢，落霞與孤鶩齋飛，秋水共長天一色。漁舟唱晚
，響窮彭蠡之濱；雁陣驚寒，聲斷衡陽之浦。遙吟俯暢，逸興遄飛，爽籟發而清風生，纖
歌凝而白雲遏。睢園緣竹，氣淩彭澤之樽；鄴水朱華，光照臨川之筆。四美具，二難并，
窮睇眄於中天，極娛遊於暇日。天高地迴，覺宇宙之無窮；興盡悲來，識盈虛之有數。望
長安於日下，指吳會於雲閒，地勢極而南溟深，天柱高而北辰遠。關山難越，誰悲失路之
人；萍水相逢，盡是他鄉之客。懷帝閽而不見，奉宣室以何年。鳴呼，時運不齊，命途多
舛，馮唐易老，李廣難封。屈賈誼於長沙，非無聖主；竄梁鴻於海曲，豈乏明時。所賴君
子安貧，達人知命。老當益壯，寧知白首之心；窮且益堅，不墜青雲之志；酌貪泉而覺爽
，處涸轍以猶懽。北海雖賒，扶搖可接；東隅已逝，桑榆非晚。孟嘗高潔，空懷報國之心
；阮籍猖狂，豈效窮途之哭。勃，三尺微命，一介書生。無路請纓，等終軍之弱冠；有懷
投筆，慕宗慤之長風。舍簪笏於百齡，奉晨昏於萬里；非謝家之寶樹，接孟氏之芳鄰。他
曰趨庭，叨陪鯉對；今農捧袂，喜托龍門。楊意不逢，撫淩雲而自惜；鍾期既遇，奏流水
以何慚。鳴呼，勝地不常，盛筳難再；蘭亭已矣，梓澤坵墟。臨別贈言，幸承恩於偉餞；
登高作賦，是所望於羣公。敢竭鄙誠，恭疏短引；一言均賦，四韻俱成。詩曰:
滕王高閣臨江渚，佩玉鳴鸞罷歌舞；畫棟朝飛南浦雲，朱簾暮捲西山雨。 閒雲潭
影日悠悠，物換星移幾度秋；閣中帝子今何在，檻外長江空自流。

人持繖隨其後，何也？」。余偶記葉紹翁《四朝聞見錄》 云：太學諸生，向用青蓋，臺
臣鄭昭先奏禁勿用，諸生皆以「皂絹為短簷繖，如都下買冰擔上所用」，此故事也。圖中
有插繖於小架上者，即買冰擔之類。王君喜其確据，因請於予曰 : 「畫，信乎南宋矣。園
亭寺觀，求一一標舉其名，使觀者有所考，則更善也」。予諾之，以遄歸未果。今年秋，
王君請益堅，乃為本《武林舊事》、《夢粱錄》諸書詳述如左。

*注 : [繩]、[曰]、[五]、[者]，四字被點去。
At right is the handscroll Picture of West Lake, which was collected by Mister Wang Chengwu of
Guangling [Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province]. Among the thousands of multistory buildings and
myriad pavilions, this ruled-line painting never fails to distinguish [the relative proportions of]
front and back, as if by the conversion method in the Timberwork Manual of Yu Hao [died 989].3
While this is indeed already quite exceptional, each of the individual elements—the landscape,
the flowers and willows, the boats and carriages, and the human figures—is finely executed.
Some renowned artist in the Painting Academy of the Southern Song dynasty made this [painting]
for presentation to the emperor, and while he regretably did not sign his name, as the tomb of Yue
Fei [1103–1142] appears in [the painting], it must [have been created by] someone [who was
active] after the reign of Emperor Xiaozong [reigned 1162–89], and I suspect [this artist] was Li
Song [late 12th–early 13th century].
In autumn, during the eighth lunar-month of the bingwu year [August 27–September 25,
1726], Mister Cheng Songmen, Mister Gu Yudong, and I visited Mister Wang, and asked if we
could have a look [at the painting]. As I am a native of Hangzhou, Mister Wang thought that I
should know something of the Southern Song, and asked me, ―Why is it that everyone in the
picture wearing an [official] hat and robes and who is going out for a walk has someone following
behind him carrying a parasol?‖ I happened to recall that the Record of Things Seen and Heard
Over Four Reigns, by Ye Shaoweng [ca. 1175–1230], includes a story, which says that the
students of the Imperial College formerly used dark umbrellas and the high minister Zheng
Zhaoxian [1157–1225] memorialized [the throne] to forbid their use, whereupon the students took
―the black silk to make short-brimmed parasols like those used on the portable [stands] of ice-
vendors in the capital.‖4 And in the picture, the parasols stuck onto their little frames are just the
kind [seen on] portable ice-vendor [stands]. Mister Wang was pleased with such concrete factual
information, and therefore asked of me, ―The painting, indeed, is truly from the Southern Song,
but if one could identify each of the gardens, pavilions, temples, and monasteries, and label them
one by one so that viewers would have something to reference, it would be even better.‖ I agreed
with him, but because I had to hasten home, nothing came of it [at the time]. In the autumn of this
year, Mister Wang asked me even more firmly [to complete the task], so I [consulted] books such
as Former Events in Wulin and Record of the Millet Dream, and have set forth the details [of what
I found] below.5

In front is a view of the [lake’s] circumference, following which it extends into a long
[horizontal] composition, starting from Qiantang Gate and ending at Qiantang Gate [again]. On
leaving Qiantang Gate, there are: the Qiantang Wine Shop, the water pavilion of Yang Hewang
[Yang Cunzhong, 1102–1166], and the Jia Family Boat Landing, where boats large and small are
moored. Next come the Boat Landing at Qiantang Gate, the Lake Viewing Tower, Bright
Blessings Temple, the New Garden of [Prince] Xiu’s residence, and the Xie Family Garden. Next
is Stone Chest Bridge, where a sluice-gate drains water into the lower lake. Next come the
Pavilion for Releasing Living [Creatures], the Hall of Virtuous Living, and the Pavilion of
Swimming and Flying. The Hall overlooks the lake, and there is a wooden fence in the water
separating it off.
Continuing from the Hall of Virtuous Living on the upper part is North Mountain Road
[which runs] along Inner Lake. The [compound] with the flowers and bamboo is Water Moon
Garden. The small temple among the willows is the Tushita [Heaven] Monastery. Next come
Large Wu Garden, Small Wu Garden, and the Great Stone Buddha Monastery. [The building]
beside the monastery is called the Tower of Thirteen Rooms, and if one counts them, it is so.
Above this are the Baoshu Pagoda and the Venerating Longevity Monastery. Next is Longevity
Star Monastery and the high terrace among the pines and bamboo is called the Grand View Over
River and Lake. Next come the Monastery of Many Treasures, the Monastery of Universal Peace, 
the Monastery of Wisdom’s Fruit, Regulating Peace Temple, Agate Monastery, and the Palace of
Jade Purity. [The buildings] along Ge Ridge overlooking the lake are called: the Yixiu Garden of
imperial son-in-law Yang, the Blossoming Fields Garden of Liu the Prince of Lu, the Nurturing
Joy Garden of Jia Pingzhang [Jia Sidao, 1213–1275], the Half Spring Garden of Shi the Prince of
Wei [Shi Miyuan, 1164–1233], and the Little Recluse Garden. The residence bestowed on Mister
Jia [Sidao] was called the Imperial Garden of Assembled Fragrances, and the towers and terraces,
flowers and trees, that mix and intermingle in shared radiance give an idea of its glory.
 Continuing from the Hall of Virtuous Living on the lower part is Lonely Hill Road, where
Broken Bridge is [located] and a myriad willows like clouds. The next is called Drenched
Emerald Bridge, and the next is called Retired Scholar Bridge. Inside the wall is Lonely Hill, and
among the pine trees is the Four-sided Hall, which is painted so that one actually [sees its] four
sides. Outside the wall, the two ancient trees that stand facing each other are cypresses [dating to]
the Chen dynasty [557–87]. Stretching along the wall and around [the corner] is a great palace
glittering with vermilion and emerald green, which is called the Western Great Unity Palace, or
the Monastery of the Four Sages Who Invite the Auspicious. Next is called the Xiling Bridge,
which is where the inner and outer lakes connect. Lonely Hill Road ends at this point.
Continuing west from Xiling Bridge, [the buildings] below the mountin are called Eternal
Longevity Temple, Magpie Temple, Summoning the Sages Temple, and Broad Transformation
Monastery. The high pavilion among the bamboo is the Bamboo Pavilion of Master Bai [Juyi,
772–846]. Next is the Manifest Light Monastery, next to which on the west, below Qixia Ridge,
is the tomb of Prince Yue [Fei], and the Honor Loyalty and Perform Blessings Monastery. Beside
Xiling Bridge and overlooking the lake are the Happiness Garden of the Zhao family and the
Water Bamboo Courtyard of Jia Pingzhang [Jia Sidao].
Continuing south from Yue [Fei’s] tomb, [the causeway] is called Su Dike. The first
bridge is called Over the Rainbow. The second bridge is called East Reach Bridge, beside which
is Little New Dike that is also planted with flowers and willows and connects to the two bridges
Ling[yin] and Zhu[tian]. [The building] on the road where a flagpole is set up is called the Shrine
of the Narcissus King, who is the Dragon King. The third bridge is called Anchoring the Dike.
The fourth bridge is called Gazing at Mountains, and on the road is the Hall of Three Sages,
which memorializes [the poets] Bai Letian [Bai Juyi, 772–846], Lin Hejing [Lin Bu, 967–1028],
and Su Dongpo [Su Shi, 1037–1101]. The fifth bridge is called Chain Ripples, and on the road is
the Hall of Former Sages. The sixth bridge is called Reflecting Waves; or if counting from the
south, Reflecting Waves is the first [bridge].
Continuing south from the six bridges is South Mountain Road, where the Promoting
Religion Temple on South Screen [Hill] is [located]; within its walls is a stone pillar [engraved
with sutras]. The next is called the Benevolent Glow Temple, with an ablution hall where [the
Southern Song imperial family] conducted sacrificial rituals [for the seven ancestors whose
graves were left behind in the north]; on the road, seven tumuli are placed, and on both sides are
small huts, six rows in all. [The buildings] overlooking the lake are called the Imperial Garden of
Emerald Fragrance, which is directly across [the water] from South Screen Hill. The next
especially grand and imposing temple is called the Chan Temple of Pure Compassion Radiant and
Filial. Directly facing the temple is the Gan Garden, with a lodge built by the court eunuch Gan
Sheng, which is half in the water, and there is a twisted and weathered pine, which is the one
referred to in the poem by the Old Man of Mouyang [Zhou Mi], ―How often has this garden
grove seen the east wind master change? / The pine beloved of emperors remains before the
courtyard.‖6 There are also the Supreme Purity Palace, Pure Visage Monastery, the Temple of
Universal Calm, and the Cloud Billows Monastery. Above, stands Thunder Peak Pagoda. Past the
pagoda are the South Garden of Han Tuozhou [1152–1207] and the True Pearl Garden of Zhang
Xunwang [Zhang Jun, 1086–1154]. The bridge with the sign [bearing] the three characters
―Clearwater Sluice‖ is called Long Bridge. Past the bridge is the Yang Family Boat Landing.
 Continuing along from Long Bridge is City Wall Road. The gate in the wall below the hill is
called Qianhu Gate, and the next is called Clear Waves Gate. Between the two gates, the area
overlooking the lake where the pavilions and terraces, flowers and willows, are the most splendid,
is called the Imperial Garden of Gathered Views, within which are the Willow Waves Bridge and 
Scholars Bridge. [The buildings] beside the garden are called Manifest Response Monastery and
Sacred Fungus Temple. The next is called Gushing Gold Gate. Outside the gate is [a structure]
called the Tower of Abundant Joy, which has swing sets and sliding gates, flowers and trees,
pavilions and gazebos, and was the most popular place for springtime outings during the
[Southern] Song dynasty. North of the tower is [a place] called Willow Isle, where the Shrine of
the Five Dragon Kings and Willow Isle Temple are located. Outside the temple is a boat landing.
Next to it is the Fish Rearing Villa of Yang Junwang [Yang Cunzhong], where there is a wooden
fence in the water, outside of which several dozen small boats are tied up and people are fishing.
Next to it is the Garden of Surrounding Green, which also belongs to the Yang family. Next is the
Welcoming Radiance Tower of Zhang Xunwang [Zhang Jun]. Next is the garden of Eunuch Liu.
Next, with open windows overlooking the water, is the Jade Lotus Hall, which is where the
dragon boats compete for trophies. Next is the Bodhi [Tree] Temple, and [the place] with all the
flowers and willows, bridges and pavilions, is called the Imperial Garden of the Jade Pot. Coming
[again] to Qiantang Gate, the [painting] ends.
The magnificence and beauty of the lake and hills during Song times is almost entirely
[realized] in this picture. Although the painter did not label the famous sites, at each scenic
location through which one passes, he left some indication that allows one to find its identity, for
the saying is true that ―a fine craftsman takes pains.‖7 May Mister Wang treasure [this painting]

(SDA- draft translation)3
Record of Merits and Achievements for a Painting of the Bodhisattva Guanyin
As Amitabha‟s supreme disciple is called Guanyin, the power of whose vow [to save all sentient
beings] lies beyond [human] thought, whose compassion extends universally to the utmost limits,
who rescues all the separate categories [of sentient beings] from suffering and harm on the Three
Paths, and removes the dark proclivities of the many incarnations on the Six Ways, this is the
One Who Shows No Fear, who dissolves and dispels urgent dangers, whom I, the unworthy one,
have had painted with complete pious sincerity. Thus I, the lady [mother], and my son the
Minister of Works speak in regard to the difficult labor of the young lady [his] new wife. As the
stars and constellations have sent down auspicious omens to the Minister of Works, and the
rivers and seas disclosed propitious signs, he employs his brush of rabbit fur and writes the eight
styles [of calligraphy] distinctly, and bends his [bow like the] shining [crescent] moon with the
extraordinary strength of a two-hundred pound pull; therefore, did I humbly conceive the
heartfelt desire to respectfully paint a true portrait [of Guanyin], and having strictly completed
drawing the features, the colors have been applied. [By virtue of which] I humbly desire that I,
the lady [mother], and the Minister of Works may receive a good destiny, and with rich blessings
enjoy the longevity of pine and cypress; and the young lady and my son her lord husband may
depend on victorious(?) karma, and with emoluments and favor live the long life of a tortoise or
crane; and lastly, that the golden branches and jade leaves of the whole imperial clan to the ninth
generation shall put aside(?) karma and together as one climb the road to enlightenment.

afraid that these are [non-canonical sutras] which have circulated for ages among the common
people. Nevertheless, [by depicting the punishments of] wicked and perfidious [persons] the
painter was able to so frighten the viewer that his hair stands on end, for ―the Ten Habits13
produce karma and create causality, and cause must lead to effect, therefore [one is affected by
the various instruments of hellish torture; and] since [these habits] derive from [erroneous

punishment [by means of] the Six Sense Organs…‖15

右唐人寫經殘卷，舊為宋漫堂布施於廬山開先孝者，今為易子石甫所得，為蟲所蝕，首尾
不具，蓋俗僧不知愛惜，石甫從破櫝中搜出者。第三行題『成都府大慈孝沙門藏川述讚』
；第四行首缺四字，下有『《….王授記四眾逆脩生七往生淨土經》』。按《新唐志》『至
德二年，改蜀郡為成都府』，曹學佺《名勝志》引《通志》云『大慈孝，唐至德年建』，
是此卷當作於唐之中業；而僧贊寧《高僧傳》不載藏川之名，宋、元、明三佛藏及高麗藏
，皆不錄此經，是則此為佛經逸篇，札未知天竺尚有梵筴否也。據翁覃溪跋稱漫堂題為『
唐末人書，即不必定属朱繇，當亦相去不遠』，余按朱繇為朱梁時人，《圖畫見聞志》稱
其『工畫佛道，酷類吳生』。此卷有《釋迦牟尼佛會圖》，殊為精妙，因以附會之，但其
兩籤題與後文經讚，實為一手書，筆法生峭，脫胎柳誠懸。今存房山唐石刻，已趨甜熟，
無此風格，何論朱梁？所惜中上古寫佛經，散佚於兵燹。今世所存墨本第有《靈飛》、《
兜沙》、《鬱草越》、《轉輪王》等經，而《靈飛》最著。袁清容直目為鍾紹京書，不知
紹京題《昇以太子碑》陰，在武后聖歷二年，《靈飛》寫於開元二十六年，時代隔越，何
能相擬？余所見日本東大孝、高山孝、法隆孝所藏古經，黃麻堅紉的為唐人書者，不下數
千卷，可謂『目不周玩，情不給賞』者，而皆無書者姓名[余所得亦數十卷，亦無書人名]，札不
必指為某名人之筆而後足珎也。余嘗謂唐人寫經，在當時不過傭書者流，未必與於書家品
騭。至今日則有極天下之選，盡一生之聰明才力，尚不能追其格度。古今人不相及，所為
有『世道升降』之嘅也。光緒乙巳仲冬十有二日，宜都楊孚敬記於鄂城菊灣。
At right is the damaged scroll of a Tang dynasty sutra manuscript that formerly was donated by
Song Mantang [Song Lao, 1634–1713] to the Kaixian Temple on Mount Lu, and has now been
acquired by Master Yi Shifu [Yi Shunding, 1858–1920]. [The scroll] had been eaten by insects
and its [painted] frontispiece is incomplete. As the common monks [at the temple] did not know
how to care for it, Shifu salvaged it from its broken covers. The third column of [the sutra] text
reads,
―Narrative and encomia by the sramana Cangchuan of Great Compassion Temple in Chengdu
Prefecture;‖23 while the fourth column is missing four characters at the beginning and then reads,
“Sutra…to the Four Orders of Disciples on the Prophecy Given to King…Concerning the Sevens
of Life to be Cultivated in Preparation for Rebirth in the Pure Land.” According to the Xin Tang
shu (New History of the Tang dynasty), ―In the second year of the Zhide reign period [757], [the
name of] Shu Commandery was changed to Chengdu Prefecture,‖24 while Cao Xuequan [1574–
1646] in his ―Record of Famous Sites‖ quotes the Tong shi [Comprehensive History] as saying,
―Great Compassion Temple was constructed during the Zhide reign period [756–58],‖25 so this
scroll must have been made during the middle period of the Tang dynasty. Yet the Gaoseng zhuan
[Lives of Eminent Monks] by the monk Zanning [919–1001] does not record the name of
Cangchuan, and neither do any of the three Buddhist Canons compiled during the Song, Yuan,
and Ming dynasties, nor the Korean Buddhist Canon, record this sutra, so this must be a lost text of
Buddhist scripture, though I do not know if there is still such a Sanskrit sutra in India or not.
Regarding the colophon by Weng Tanqi [Weng Fanggang, 1733–1818], where he states that
Mantang’s26 inscription says, ―It was written by someone at the end of the Tang dynasty, and
while it need not be attributed to Zhu You, it shouldn’t be by anyone too far from him either,‖ I
note that Zhu You was a man of the Zhu-Liang dynasty [907–923],27 and the Tuhua jianwen zhi
praised him as ―skilled at Buddhist and Daoist subjects, very much like Master Wu [Daozi,
active ca. 710– 760].‖28 This scroll includes a Picture of an Assembly of the Blessed Sakyamuni
Buddha Who Extinguishes Just Rewards, which was appended because of its particularly
exquisite qualities; however, the inscriptions in the two cartouches [on the painting] were actually
written by the same hand as the texts of the sutra and encomia that follow. The calligraphy is
quite vigorous and derives from [that of] Liu Chengxuan [Liu Gongquan, 778–865]. Now the
stone inscriptions [of the Buddhist Canon] from the Tang dynasty preserved on Mount Fang [in
Hebei Province]29 already exhibit full [technical] maturity and do not at all possess the style [of
writing seen here], so how can one speak of the [much later] Zhu-Liang dynasty? Regretably,
[most of] the Buddhist sutras written during middle antiquity have been lost to fire and sword, and
of those originals that do survive in the world today, such as the Lingfei, Dousha, Yucaoyue [?],
Zhuanlunwang, and other sutras, [the calligrapy of] the Lingfei is the very best. Yuan Qingrong
[Yuan Jue, 1266–1327] held the view that it was written by Zhong Shaojing [active 680–730s],30
but he didn’t know that Shaojing inscribed the reverse side of the Stele of the Heir Apparent
Becoming an Immortal in the second year of the Shengli reign period of Empress Wu [699], while
the Lingfei [sutra] was written during the twenty-sixth year of the Kaiyuan reign period [738].
With [the writing of these two texts] being so far apart in time, how could they resemble each
other? Of the ancient sutras that I have seen in the collections of the Tōdaiji, Kōzanji, and Hōryūji
in Japan, those that were written by Tang dynasty individuals on tough but pliable jute [paper]
number no fewer than several thousand scrolls, which one may say are ―too many to see and too
much to enjoy,‖31 yet none of them bear the names of those who wrote them (and the several dozen scrolls that I have collected also bear no writers’ names), which exactly [goes to show] that
one should not [consider a calligraphy] worth treasuring only if it has been assigned to the brush
of someone famous. I have said that, at the time, sutra writers in the Tang were nothing more than
a class of commercial scribes, and [their works] certainly do not come up to those by [true]
calligraphers. But today, even if one could choose [among sutras written during the Tang] from
absolutely everywhere in the world and devote all of one’s intelligence and talent [to their study]
for a lifetime, one would still not be able to trace [the evolution of] their rules of composition. The
fact that calligraphers from past to present cannot equal [them], is a cause for bemoaning ―the
vicissitudes of the world.‖32 Twelfth day of the mid-winter [eleventh] lunar month in the yisi year

From Muro Jōsei (early 18th century):
Liang Kai lived 520 years ago during the Jiatai reign-period [1201–04] of the Song dynasty,
which corresponds to the Kennin reign-period [1201–03] of Emperor Tsuchimikado [reigned
1198–1210].
․Chan-master Zide Huihui [1097–1183], [abbot] of Jingci Temple [Hangzhou, Zhejiang
Province], lived during the Chunxi reign-period [1174–89] of the Song dynasty, 550 years ago.
․Zide‟s disciple was Chan-master Mingji Huizuo [mid-12th–early 13th century], [abbot] of
Huacang Temple [Changzhou, Jiangsu Province].
․Mingji‟s disciple was Chan-master Donggu Miaoguang [died 1253].
․Donggu‟s disciple was Chan-master Zhiweng Deju [13th century], [abbot] of Tiantong Temple
[Ningbo, Zhejiang Province].
․Zhiweng‟s disciple was Chan-master Dongming Huiri [1272–1340], [abbot] of Kenchō-ji
[Kamakura, Japan], who came to our country in the second year of the Enkyō reign-period
[1309] of Emperor Hanazono [reigned 1308–18].

From Gion Yoichi [unidentified, 18th century].
Liang Kai. His biography [appears] in the Tuhui baojian [Precious Mirror for Examining
Painting] and other books, which include his paintings in the top category.4 During the Jiatai
reign-period [1201–04] of Emperor Ning of the Song dynasty, he served as an Attendantinwaiting in the [Imperial] Painting Academy, an official rank for painters. [The date given] at
right corresponds to the Kenji period [see below] in the reign of Emperor Tsuchimikado, which
was some 550–60 years before today.
8. Anonymous emendation of previous document (1735) – or same hand as above (?)
 Ink on one strip of paper.

Kenji was the name of a reign-period [1275–77] under Emperor Go-uda [reigned 1274–87], the
nintieth in succession. If [Liang Kai lived] during the time of Emperor Tsuchimikado [reigned
1198–1210], the eighty-third in succession, then [the reign-period] must be Kennin [1201–03]. It
is the four-hundred and sixty-first year from yihai, the first year of Kenji [1275], to yimao, the
twentieth year of Kyōhō [1735]. It is the five-hundred and thirty-fifth year from xinyou, the first
year of Kennin [1201], to yimao, the twentieth year of Kyōhō [1735]. ",(none),National Museum of Asian Art (Freer Sackler),F1907.141,"Gookin, Frederick William (1854–1936), comp. The Art Institute of Chicago: Catalogue of a

青。而或長煙一空，皓月千里，浮光躍金，靜影沈璧，漁歌互答，此樂何極？登斯樓也，
則有心曠神怡，寵辱皆忘，把酒臨風，其喜洋洋者矣。嗟夫！予嘗求古仁人之心，或異二

Each of the Eighteen Yingzhen [Luohan] Who Respond to the Truth and Reside in the World, by
virtue of his own enlightened Samadhi, manifests every kind of rare and extraordinary [quality]
on every state and plane [of existence], as his supernatural powers transform and mutate,
possessing marvelous functions without limit. See the lofty mountains, tall and towering, whose
green [mass] thrusts to the shores of heaven, and the emerald sea, deep and gaping, whose
snowcapped billows glisten in the void; [where among] the ancient trees and new bamboo,
verdant pines and strange stones, [luohan receive] the respectful homage of empresses and lady
officials, or are assisted by an entourage of earth spirits and field imps, and whether a great
serpent is holding its breath until its poisonous flames extinguish themselves, or a fierce tiger is
submitting to them while its ferocity naturally dissipates, they sit with folded legs exhibiting a
relaxed demeanor, or move about displaying an ineffable dignity, causing one the instant he
opens the scroll to unconsciously find himself there upon the Stone Bridge at Fangguang
[Temple].3 I have heard the teaching which says: “Outwardly reveal the body of a śrāvaka;
inwardly conceal the conduct of a bodhisattva,” but as the “outward revealing” [of their forms] is 
already completed [in this painting], and you may have an inkling about what is meant by
“inwardly concealed,” there’s no harm if I explain it to you in a gatha, which says:
Strange in form and shape, parted from the silken cage,
In the state of only-mind, one to next is all the same.
Aside from news that is reported of these eighteen men,
One cannot use brush and paper to paint the empty void.
The Superintendent Laobian keeps this scroll in his luggage, and one day during in a break from
meditation he raised it and commanded me to put some words together and inscribe them at its
end. The Old Ascetic of the Abode of Illusion on West Tianmu Mountain, [Zhongfeng]

The Tang-dynasty monk Huaisu [ca. 725–ca. 799] is famous throughout the world for his cursive
calligraphy. Those who appreciated good calligraphy in the Tang also esteemed him greatly, and
he composed a piece called the Autobiographical Preface which fully records the verses of
various writers [in praise of his work].13 Huaisu especially enjoyed writing on silk and, from first
to last, of the several scrolls acquired for my collection not a single character was written on
paper. The first work [on paper] that I acquired is the [present] poem, ―Everyone keeps sending
wine.‖ Laoquan shanren [Su Shi] practiced [Huaisu’s] calligraphy for forty years and particularly
loved this poem, which he wrote out time after time using no fewer than several dozen sheets [of
paper] each time. It was on such an occasion, then, that Longmian Li Boshi [Li Gonglin] created
this painting. As he was able to capture the demeanor of the drunken monk quite well and
Laoquan’s calligraphy constitutes a style and form all its own, [together] they indeed make a
picture of two marvels. Written by Dongcun in retirement at a Buddhist temple…

In regard to this picture: In Bian Yongyu’s Shuhua huikao, below the poem ―Sending Wine,‖ the
following eleven words are attached: ―Laoquan inscribed this poem by Huaisu and imitated his
cursive style [of calligraphy].‖15 And following the poem is a colophon, which bears the signature,
―Written by Dongcun while living in retirement at a Buddhist hall…,‖ whose identity [along
with Laoquan’s] is also unknown. Now the Tuhua jianwen zhi records a Picture of a Drunken
Monk by Zhang Sengyou [active ca. 500–550] that bears a poem by Huaisu, which is exactly the
quatrain [written] here and is recorded [as his] in the Quan Tang shi [Complete Tang Poetry].16
When Xihongtang [Dong Qichang] cut the calligraphy [into a woodblock and reproduced it], he 
said: ―It may be that, since Dongpo [Su Shi] had written out this poem [on some occasion],
someone simply inserted it into his collected works by mistake.‖17 But Bian
Yongyu’s Shuhua huikao records Dong [Qichang’s] colophon for this painting, where he states
that Laoquan wrote it. Thus, [Dong] Qichang already held divergent theories about the work.18
On the other hand, Dong’s colophon for the scroll is lost, and the Collected Works of Su Shi
record this poem under the title ―Inscribed on [an example of] cursive script by Huaisu.‖ It is one
and the same poem, but some [sources] say it is by Huaisu, and others say it is by Dongpo [Su
Shi]; it is one and the same calligraphy, but some sources say it is by Laoquan, while others say
that it is by Dongpo. Connoisseurs and appraisers should just discuss whether a painting or
calligraphy is beautiful or not, and ought not muck around with discrepancies among written
records, for rather than give credence [to one source over another], it would be better to simply
leave the issue open. Inscribed again [by the emperor] during the first lunar month in the jiachen
year [January 22–February 20, 1784].19

I once saw the painting Mountain Villa by Li Gonglin [ca. 1049–1106].29 His use of ink was
beautiful and elegant, and his application of color skillful and refined. He had truly entered the
inner sanctum of Mojie [Wang Wei, 701–762].30 As for his figure painting and Buddhist images,
it was as if he used a lantern to take their shadows, coming forward or moving away, the way that
gossamer goes whirling around without a trace. Even a Wu Daozi [active ca. 710–760] or Gu
Hutou [Gu Kaizhi, ca. 344–ca. 406] could not surpass this scroll.31 For this scroll, it is clear that
Laoquan [Su Shi] had previously written out the ―Poem on the Drunken Monk‖ and that Boshi
[Li Gonglin] made the painting to complement it. They are exactly what is called a joined pair of
beauties.Viewed by Dong Qichang at the Huishan marina.32","91 Total – including 15 half-seals

憩，古屋何人供酒食。赤幘烏衫固可亨，美人清血終難得，不如歸飲中山釀，一醉三年萬緣息
。卻愁有物覷高明，八姨豪買他人宅，□□君醒為掃除，馬嵬金馱去无跡。 人言墨鬼為戲筆，
是大不然。此乃書家之艸聖也，世豈有不善真書，而能作艸者？在昔善畫墨鬼，有姒妙頤真、
趙千里。千里《丁香鬼》誠為奇特，所惜去人物科太遠，故人得以戲筆目之。頤真鬼雖甚工，
然其用意猥近，甚者作髯君野溷，一豪豬即之，妹子持杖披襟趕遂，此何為者耶？僕今作《中
山出遊圖》，蓋欲一洒頤真之陋，庹不廢翰墨清玩。譬之書，猶真、行之間也。鍾馗事絕少，
僕前後為詩，未免重用，今即他事成篇，聊出新意焉耳。淮陰龔開記。

My Lord Whiskers’ family home was located on Zhongshan, He
harnessed up and out he went, but whither did he go?
Said he’d make a little hunt without the hawks and dogs, But
I believe his reason had to do with house and home.
Little sister’s lovely face was all made up and powdered, Of
ointments in five colors, the best for her was black.
On coming to a way station she had to take a little rest, 
In that old hut who was there to give her wine and food? While
Red Turban and Black Shirt can certainly be boiled, The pure
blood of a beauty will in the end be hard to get.
Isn’t it better to go home and drink some Zhongshan brew, And
once drunk, for three long years be oblivious to all?
Renouncing sorrow someone watched the clever and bright,
Sister-in-law Eight by force bought other people’s homes. But
when My Lord had sobered up, he swept them all away, At
Mawei Slope the golden load was gone without a trace.
People say that painting demons in ink is just doodling, but this is greatly untrue. It is
more like a calligrapher who is a prodigy of grass script: Is there anyone in the world
who is unskilled in standard script, yet is able to write in grass? In the past, Si Yizhen [ ]
and Zhao Qianli [Zhao Boju, active 1120s–1162] were skilled at painting demons in ink.
Qianli’s Clove Demon was truly special and unique, but what a pity he departed so far
from the genre of figure painting, for people were able to use [that departure] to
categorize his work as mere doodling. And while Yizhen’s demons were very
wellcrafted, their subject matter was near to obscene, going so far as to to show Lord
Whiskers [Zhong Kui] in a field privy with a porcupine going for him, and his sister with
an open blouse wielding a stick to drive it away. What kind of a thing was this? In now
making Zhongshan Going on Excursion, it is because I wish to flush away Yizhen’s filth,
and hope I have not abandoned the pure pleasures of brush and ink. Comparing [this
work] to calligraphy, it lies somewhere between standard script and running script.
Extremely little is known about Zhong Kui, all of which from beginning to end I put in
my poem, and since I could not [otherwise] avoid repetition, I have addressed other
matters in this postscript simply to express something new. Recorded by Gong Kai of
Huaiyin.

老夫書倦眼模糊，睡魔麾去復來不受驅。故人偶過蓬蒿居，授我一卷牛腰墨戲圖。午牎拭眥試
展玩，使我三嘂還長吁。人間何處有此境，衆鬼雜遝相奔趨。一翁烏帽袍鞾，兩鬼共舉藤輿出
。怒瞠兩目髯舒戟，阿妹雙臉無脂鈆，只調松煤塗抹色如漆。歬呵后殿皆鬼徒，亦有橫桃直桃
之鬼物。又有獰鬼數輩相隨各執役。陰風淒淒寒起袂，道是九首山人出游中山捕諸鬼。三郎聰
明晚何謬，玉環狐媚不悟祿兒醜。當年曾偷寧王玉笛吹，豈信此徒亦復[來]
2效顰來肆欺，馗也
詎能一一盡擒捉，舉世滔滔定復誰知覺，我欲嘑髯扣其術，人言个是翠嵓老子遊戲筆，却憶漁
陽鐵騎來如雲，騎騾倉遑了無策，錦韈游魂意弗歸，方士排空御氣無从覓。老嵓去我久，九京
難再作，遺墨敗楮空零落，安得江波化作蒲萄之新醅。畫鼓四面轟春雷，叱去羣魅不復顧，大
笑滿傾三百杯。

Whenever I open Zhongshan Going on Excursion for my amusement, everyone who sees
it invariably exclaims in surprise. All the strange shapes and unusual forms of the age—
the fierce and cruel or wily and cunning, the strong and the weak gulping and gnawing—
appear in the hundreds, changing deceitfully. But it has gone so far that many people do
not consider even such evil demons to be odd, and the reason is probably because they
have heard them and seen them around for so long that they have been completely
transformed as well, and therefore view [such apparitions] as normal. Oh, how profound
is the meaning of this painting of Old Man Whiskers! The only part of the Zhong Kui
story that some people consider doubtful is that he appeared in the Bright Emperor’s
dream. But I say that from past to present [time has passed] like a shooting star or bolt of
lightning, and glowing reputations and forlorn sorrows have sprouted like fungus and
burst like bubbles, so that the only thing there is left to doubt is what is not a dream. In
appending some words now at the end of the scroll, couldn’t this also be talking of
dreams while in a dream? Inscribed by Boshiweng [Old Man Raincape] of Donghu.

翠巖龔先生，負荊楚雄俊才 8，不為世用，故其胸中磊磊落落者，發為怪怪奇奇。在豪端游戲，
氣韻筆法，非俗工所可知。然多作汗血，『老驥伏櫪』，態度若生，蓋『志在千里』也。寫《
中山出遊圖》，髯君顧盼氣吞，萬夫輿從，詭異雜沓，魑魅束縳以待烹，使剛正者覩之心快，
姦佞見之膽落，故知先生之志，在掃盪兇邪耳，豈徒以清玩目之？噫，先生已矣，至今耿光逼
人。後學象山周耘敬識。

Master Cuiyan Gong [Kai] was a brave and noble talent from Jing-Chu [the area of
modern Hunan and Hubei provinces], but he was not employed by the times, so the
discontentment in his breast was expressed in [depictions of] the strange and unusual. In
the play of his brush tip, his resonant and atmospheric style is not something that a
common craftsman can understand. Thus, he often made [paintings of] blood-sweating
[steeds], where ―the old thoroughbred bent over his trough‖ bears itself as it did in life,
for it [still] ―has the will to go a thousand li.‖9 The way he painted Zhongshan Going on
Excursion—Lord Whiskers glaring about in suppressed rage; the myriad-strong
entourage surrounding his sedan chair, a confused crowd of the fantastic and the odd;
sprites and goblins bound and tied, waiting to be boiled—causes the resolute and upright
to be glad of heart when they view it, and the wicked and deceitful to lose courage upon
seeing it. Therefore, we know that the master’s intent was to sweep and scour away evil
and malignancy, so how could one merely view [the painting] as pure entertainment? Oh,
the master may indeed be gone, but to this day his glorious light compels one!

翠喦翁為宋臣，入元遂不仕。人品如此，故書畫皆妙絕。所作八分，全用篆灋，有秦權量、漢
汾陰鼎、綏和壺遺意。其圖鬼物，怪怪奇奇，用意要非玩戲而已。詩曰，『為鬼為蜮，則不可

As Old Man Cuiyan [Gong Kai] had been an official under the Song dynasty, upon
entering the Yuan, he did not serve [in government]. His quality as a person was like this,
and therefore both his calligraphy and painting are exceptionally marvelous. For his
[colophon in] clerical script, he fully employed a style of seal script that is reminiscent of
[the writing found on] steelyards from the Qin dynasty [221–207 b.c.e.], or the Fenyin
tripod [ding] and Suihe pot from the Han dynasty [206 b.c.e. –c.e. 220]. And while the
demonic creatures he depicted are indeed strange and odd, the idea behind them is
emphatically not one of amusement or play. As the [Classic of] Poetry says: ―It’s a
demon, it’s a reptile, / Then it cannot be predicted.‖10 As [creatures] such as this bunch
are certainly not few in the world, how can we serve them all for Lord Whiskers [Zhong
Kui] to suck and chew? Twenty-fifth day in the second lunar-month of the dinghai year

自唐吳道子作《鍾馗出遊圖》，其後畫者日衆，盖離奇虛誕，各有所寄也。龔翠嵓入元不仕，
旅舍無炊，往往攤紙於其子之背，為圖易米。人爭購之，然所傳於世亦無多。丁丑冬，余請養
初還，得其《羸馬圖》於吳門。今年六月又得其《中山出遊圖》。二卷皆極著者，前賢題跋多
且佳，余故竝珎之。客曰：『昔[日]
11 人詩篇圖畫，多託之馬者，或以喻才俊，或以傷不遇，尚
有意在。似此鬼隊滿前，何所取乎？』余曰：『不然。世之人形而鬼恠其行者，不一而足，安
知此輩貌醜而不心質耶？凡遇世事之可喜、可諤、可駭、可怒、可悲、可歎者，取玆觀之，必
忽尓大笑，以古人為不爽。』康熙庚辰七夕前一日，立秋旬餘，餘暑日熾軒窓，近晚始有微涼

Ever since Wu Daozi [active ca. 710–760] of the Tang dynasty did the picture Zhong Kui
Going on Excursion, those who emulated him have grown more numerous by the day,
which is probably because [the subject] lends itself to the bizarre and fanciful. Gong
Cuiyan [Gong Kai] lived into the Yuan dynasty, but did not serve [in government], so he
had nothing to cook at his hostel, and frequently spread paper on his son’s back to make
pictures in exchange for rice. People competed to buy them; however, not very many
have passed down in the world. In winter of the dingchou year [1697], when I first
returned from recuperating, I acquired his Emaciated Horse in Wumen [Suzhou], and this
year in the sixth lunar month, I also acquired his Zhongshan Going on Excursion. As
these two scrolls are [Gong Kai’s] most illustrious [surviving works], and the colophons
inscribed [on them] by former worthies are both numerous and beautiful, I prize them
both equally. A visitor said: ―Many poems and paintings by men of the past used the
horse as a symbol, and whether it was as a metaphor of great talent, or of a person born 
out his time, there was still an [underlying] meaning to it. But what is one to take from a
group of demons like the one that fills the [paper] in front of us?‖ I replied: ―Not so, for
more than one person in the world is human in outward form, but behaves like a demon
in his actions, so how can one know that this bunch, though ugly in appearance, might
not have real character of mind? Whenever I encounter something in life that provokes
joy, or honesty, or fear, or anger, or grief, or sighs, I take this out and look at it, and I’m
bound to have a good laugh, for the ancients never fail [in their purposes], I think.‖ The
day before Seventh Night in the gengchen year of the Kangxi reign period [August 20,
1700]—it is more than ten days after Establishing Autumn, and the sun blazed at my
studio window in the lingering summer heat. Only near evening did it get a bit cooler, so
I rinsed off my inkstone to pass the time and wrote out these words. When I was done
writing and stood up, the slender moon was already at the edge of the eaves. The jasmine
flowers have opened and fill the bushes with a riot of color, [making me] recall my youth
and the smells of a different [time and] place. The old collector of River Village, Gao
Shiqi.

In Daoist tradition, the Great Divinities [known as] the Three Ministers are the Three Perfected
Rulers, Tang, Ge, and Zhou. They were painted by Grandmaster of the Palace, Lord He [Cheng],
who is now in his eighty-seventh year. That he walks without a cane, sits without hunching, and
eats like a man in his fifties or sixties is likely because he takes much better care of himself on a
daily basis than other men. If it were not so, how could he wield his brush and create paintings
with such undiminished vigor that even those in their youth truly have no way to keep up! For a
hundred generations to come, [when people] unroll and view [this painting], he shall suffer no
shame before the famous masters of the Tang. Inscribed by Chouzhai Zhang Zhongshou from

Grandmaster He [Cheng‘s] painting of the Three Ministers has been in my family collection for
years, only I do not know where he was from and am equally uncertain as to his given and
courtesy names. According to [the previous colophon by] Zhang Zhongshou, in the third year of
the Zhida reign period [1310] he was said to be in his eighty-seventh year. The third year in
Zhida was a gengxu year during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Yuan dynasty [reigned 1308–
11]. Reckoning back [from this date], the Grandmaster was born in jiashen during the reign of
Emperor Ning of the Song dynasty [reigned 1195–1224] in the seventeenth year of the Jiading
reign period [1224], so he was actually a man of the Song dynasty and was [already] in his thirtyseventh year at the beginning of the Yuan [1260]. While I have been unable to determine if he
served [in government] under the Song or not, in the Precious Mirror of Paintings we find that,
―Grand Master He was skillful at painting men and horses; as the poem by Yu Bosheng [Yu Ji,
1271–1348] says: ‗Grandmaster He was a master painter at our [Yuan] imperial court / And
personally copied the painting Pasturing Horses by [Li] Boshi‘,‖ so it is indeed certain that he
served [in government] during the Yuan.5
 As to whether he painted in a meticulous or rough
manner, the previous statement covers it all. If we count from gengxu, the third year of Zhida
[1310], to jisi, the fourteenth year in the Zhengtong reign period of our [Ming] dynasty [1449], 
then this is the one hundred and fortieth year [since the painting was created]. I write this in the
hope that future viewers will uncover more about [the artist]. On the first day of the third lunar
month [March 24], recorded by Li Yong, [courtesy name] Shixing, from Hailing, at the east
window of my Qingsuo [studio] in Qijun [Shandong Province].

古人論畫人物 :『如燈取影，逆來順往，旁見側出。橫斜平直，各相乘除，有自然之數』

In discussing the painting of human figures, someone long ago [wrote]: ―Like using a lantern to
capture shadows, so that whether [the figure] is coming or going, or seen in profile from the side, 
one adjusts the proportions of the horizontal, diagonal, level, and straight, each to the other, until
they achieve a natural whole.‖6 Whether hidden or revealed, facing front or facing back, moving
or stationary, lying down or looking up, whether vertical or horizontal or every which way, the
figures painted by Grandmaster He are each presented in a precise and orderly fashion. [Thus]
the Grandmaster attained the idea expressed by that person long ago in his discussion of painting,
and I truly believe Zhang Zhongshou‘s assertion that his painting would ―suffer no shame
before [the famous masters of] the Tang.‖

Calligraphy flourished in the Jin dynasty [260–420] and painting flourished in the Tang [618–
907], but it was during the Song dynasty [960–1279] that calligraphy and painting [flourished]
together as one. Thus, a gentleman [of the time] who was proficient in painting must have been
proficient in calligraphy, for his approach to painting was exactly [the same as] his approach to 
calligraphy. Looking now at the Three Ministers painted by Grandmaster He, each of the sundry
figures—whether large or small, refined or coarse—is absolutely marvelous in its own way,
while the brushwork throughout [the painting] is entirely calligraphic. So if anyone says that
[Grandmaster He] was not proficient in calligraphy, I do not believe it. On the day after

In everything, one should simply value skill and that is all. Regarding these three scrolls, they
surpass the Jin and outdo the Tang, and no one but a mature artist of the Yuan could even think
of achieving this [level of excellence]. Should some viewer take them as Daoist diversions that
cannot compare with [Wang] Xizhi‘s [calligraphy of religious texts such as the] Scripture of the
Yellow Court or his Preface to the Sacred Teachings, then is it because he places more value on
fine calligraphy [than on excellent painting]?7 Treasure them greatly, treasure them greatly. Li X

One day when Master Dongpo was governor of Huzhou, he went on a excursion to the He and
Dao mountains, where he encountered a storm.1 Turning back to rest at Jia Yunlao's Pavilion of
Limpid Radiance by the stream, he ordered one of his underlings to hold a candle while he
painted a branch of windblown bamboo on a section of the wall.2 Later an enthusiast had [the
image] engraved on stone and placed it in the county school. Once when I was traveling along
Zha [Creek], I [had occasion] to run my hands over the broken tablet, and could not bear to part
from it.3 I always keep that original [image] in mind, and whenever I approach the inkwell, I
forthwith paint a version of it, but [only manage] to capture one ten-thousandth [of its likeness]. 
So I have made this branch and record the date. Written by the Plum Daoist [Wu Zhen] in his
seventy-first year, on Bamboo Drunk Day, summer, thirteenth day in the fifth lunar-month of
gengyin, the tenth year in the Zhizheng reign period [June 17, 1350].4

The Master of the Plum Blossom Studio [Wu Zhen] copied a Branch of Bamboo in the Wind by
[Su] Dongpo. His brushwork is powerful yet elegant and profoundly captures that eternal 
master‟s bequeathed intent. The best paintings that my late father [Di Xuegeng] collected by the
Master [of the Plum Blossom] Studio were a landscape hanging scroll on silk, a landscape
handscroll on paper, and this [work], which makes three, all of which are now in my collection.
Being sick, I unrolled [the paintings] to have a look, and remembered back to those years when
my younger brother Nan and I stood together in attendance [on our father] and critically
discussed the relative merits of these three [works]. But those events were thirty years ago, and
three years have already passed since my younger brother Nan departed the world. Only this
painting survives unscathed, so I cannot help but sigh in lament. Inscribed by Pingzi [Di

Mister Xia Yanzhe of Wujun [modern Suzhou] is broadly cultured and fond of antiquities. He
once purchased a handscroll in the marketplace, and when he brought it out to show me, it
[turned out] to be A Myriad Bamboo by my late friend, master Song Zhongwen [Song Ke].
Observing the utterly marvelous [quality] of his brushwork—[the scene] desolate and lonely
stretching off into the distance, with numerous [bamboo] but not too much, and not one leaf
carelessly done—[the painting] rather resembles [the works of] Danyou and Fangshan in concept
and flavor.1 Every day [Song Ke] loved to play his qin [zither], for which he possessed the
inclination of a Boya, and even more capable was he in calligraphy, capturing the secret brush 
[techniques] of the Two Wangs, while he was also skilled in the art of bird-forms.2 Exceedingly
clever and intelligent, he put [his talents] to many uses, and as he was inferior to none in any of
the sundry things [he undertook], there was no one who did not have respect for him. So I have
composed a short stanza, as follows:
The vice-prefect of Fengxiang has become an immortal,3
Since he left, I’m suddenly surprised twenty years have passed.
I unroll this scroll of bamboo thickets, where his ink remains, And
am moved to renewed sorrow as I open it and look.

1 During the early Ming dynasty, Song Ke (1327–1387) served for a time as vice-prefect (tongzhi
同知) of Fengxiang county (near Xi’an in Shaanxi Province), where some sources say he died.
This line of poetry is built around an elaborate play on words that supports this idea. The literal
translation of the placename Fengxiang is ―phoenix soaring,‖ while the term used here for Song
Ke’s rank, biejia 別駕, literally means ―departing carriage.‖ Finally, the expression xianyou 仙
游
, meaning ―to go off roaming as an immortal‖—which is to say ―becoming an immortal‖—is a
euphemism for dying. Taken literally, then, line 1 reads: ―Departing by carriage like a soaring
phoenix, he has gone off roaming as an immortal;‖ while stripped to its barest essentials, it says:
―Since Song Ke died as an official in Fengxiang county.‖ ",,https://ids.si.edu/ids/download/id/FS-8030_05

題友人梅花卷我家家在吳山住，路入梅花最深處， 天空歲晚雪紛飛，遶屋
寒香千萬樹。 花時日日醉花邊，酒醒長吟花下眠， 聽到翠禽啼欲斷，任
教明月照青天。 自從遊宧京華久，夢繞花前與花後， 故山花發想依然，
何遜才華已非舊。 霜臺御史繡衣人，藏得橫斜水面真， 一幅齊紈裁皎雪
，筆端渾是玉精神。 蕭齋凍雨檐花落，紙帳夜寒燈影薄， 恍然相對似還
家，春信依稀生綠萼。 綠萼春生日漸多，山中歸計尚蹉跎， 玉堂日醉宮
壺酒，其奈梅花似雪何。 何當便赴看花約，莫待霜天吹曉角， 詩成却向
畫中題，酒熟空思花下酌。 
Inscribed on a friend’s handscroll [painting] of plum blossoms. [Poem translation forthcoming].

余素不能作詩，於詠梅詩尤不敢作。蓋古人賦詠者甚多，而鱠炙人口者絕寡。余雖欲繼其後
塵，惟恐點汙清格，未嘗道著一字。茲承見示詠梅十絕，索和甚力，勉為摹寫萬一。梅其有
靈，必為見誚。
探梅 (Seeking Plum Blossoms)
山廻風急馬行遲，雪墮松梢打接籬，昨夜陽春添得否，舊枝應不似新枝。
種梅 (Planting Plum Blossoms)
若無詩興如東閣，空有忘憂在北堂，移得孤根候旾色，林逋知我也非常。
觀梅 (Viewing Plum Blossoms)
兩眼看華正未昏，華含微笑欲譚論，世人只[我]愛 7顏如玉，心在天先用默存。
折梅 (Plucking Plum Blossoms) 百歲冰梢斗柄迴，一時斷折為華開，小窓雪後寒如水，何得紛
紛白蝶來。
浴梅 (Bathing Plum Blossoms)
紅帶束腰旾意淺，瓊漿入口玉顏開，飄飄欲訪西王母，無奈瑤池雨勒廻。
嚼梅 (Tasting Plum Blossoms)
蜜蜂空有一生狂，此味從來不得甞，我愛芳馨如齧雪，幸無蘇武九廻腸。
夢梅 (Dreaming Plum Blossoms)
彷彿山林見白雲，等閒冰雪冷詩魂，看華不到長安道，只在江南烟水邨。
畫梅 (Painting Plum Blossoms)
羣僊正欲乘風去，憑仗丹青喚得回，寶鴨焚香供燕坐，春風庭院綠牎 8開。
梅魂 (Soul of Plum Blossoms)
香滿羅幃凝不消，篴聲吹斷夜迢迢，霜蜚月落無尋處，欲倩青衣使者招。
玉頰凝寒強對人，今秊消瘐不勝春，相知只有窓前月，摹寫清風水上身。

I am usually unable to compose poetry, and especially would not dare to compose a poem on the
theme of plum blossoms, for while there are many verses composed on the theme by men of the
past, exceptionally few are popularly relished. And though I wished to follow in their dust, I was
afraid to defile the purity of the genre, and never uttered or wrote a single word. But now that I
have had the honor of being shown your “Ten Quatrains on the Theme of Plum Blossoms,” and
you have importuned me so mightliy to [compose a set of verses to] harmonize [with their
rhymes], I have exerted myself in emulating but one ten-thousandth [of their beauty]. As the plum
tree possesses an innate spirit, [my poems] surely must be reproved.

右探梅 (At right: Seeking Plum Blossoms)

孤根入手帶冰霜，移向林逋舊草堂，分付兒童勤愛護，來春生意倍尋常。
右種梅 (At right: Planting Plum Blossoms)
雪消風暖月黃昏，滿目[風]春 11光不可論，看遍西湖舊遊路，好華今有幾株存。
右觀梅 (At right: Viewing Plum Blossoms)
只尺溪南幾往迴，疎花還向掌中開，隴頭近日無知已，前路休傳驛使來。
右折梅 (At right: Plucking Plum Blossoms)
露華如水滴瑤臺，冰雪襟懷偶試開，浣盡香塵清透骨，玉顏呈處百花廻。
右浴梅 (At right: Bathing Plum Blossoms)
手摘瑤花喜欲狂，箇中滋味許誰嘗，香鬚嚙破餘冰雪，沁入搜詩舊肺腸。
右嚼梅 (At right: Tasting Plum Blossoms) 
醉來欹枕臥黎雲，夢逐寒香幾斷魂，一夜月華清似水，隨風又過嶺南村。
右夢梅 (At right: Dreamiing Plum Blossoms)
一枝和月臨窓几，便覺春從硯沼回，欲寫風神歸舊譜，毫端彷彿見花開。
右畫梅 (At right: Painting Plum Blossoms)
歷盡冰霜恨不消，冷風殘雪路迢迢，縱然夜落錢塘渚，未許山林俗士招。
右梅魂 (At right: Soul of Plum Blossoms)
稜稜瘦骨冷侵人，佔斷西湖水底春，昨夜小窓殘月暝，不知何處著吟身。

Of alchemist masters in Hedong, there are the brothers Fu,
Men among gods and immortals nothing about them is common
The junior Fu knows how to paint the plums of Huaguang,
And the senior Fu knows how to paint bamboo like Wen Tong;
When Wen Tong’s dragon departed it smashed the wall apart, While
Huaguang was able to detain the breath of spring.
Just as he lay sweetly dreaming of the Great Tree Immortal,
A bluebird called out dreaming, the east is getting light.9
Upon arriving at Hesha, I moored at the Cinnabar Chamber of the Cavern Mystery, where
my host is the alchemist master [Zou] Fulei.10 After offering tea, he brought forth some
[sheets of] Clear River mulberry paper and begged me three times for [a work of] brush
and ink.11 Both the master and his older brother Fuyuan can write poetry and paint. After
looking at some bamboo by Fuyuan, I looked at a painting of plum blossoms by Fulei. On
the scroll is [a frontispiece] by the Old Immortal Mountain Dweller [Yuan Yu] inscribed
with the title reading A Breath of Spring, so I composed [the above] poem for the end of
the scroll. Autumn in the xinchou year of the Zhizheng reign period, on the twentyseventh

The vital qualities of yin and yang are either pure or impure. If the vital quality one
receives at birth is pure, then what one likes will also be pure, and the impure is not
involved in it. If the vital quality one receives is impure, then what one likes will also be
impure, and the pure does not mingle with it. That the pure cannot be impure, and the
impure cannot be pure, is assuredly a principle of nature. Master Zou Fulei of Yundong
lives in a studio [named] the Tumbleweed [Shack]. If he enjoys any free time after his
zither and books, painting plum trees is his particular pleasure. Having been at it for a
long time, he has discovered the untransmitted secrets of Huaguang [died 1123], and 
worked out all the intricacies for [depicting] the windblown branches and snowladen buds
of each unique kind and unusual shape. Now the plum tree is the purest of all living
things, having an insouciant quality unsullied by the smallest speck of mundane dust.
Beyond [being a suitable subject for] singing and chanting in the frost and moonlight,
what is estimable about the plum is not simply its purity, but the courage that it shows in
[blooming during] the winter of the year. Without embarrassment, you, Fulei, truly
compare in virtue to the purity of the plum tree, and thus I have written this as a preface
for you. Tenth year of the Zhizheng reign period, with the year-star in the [sign of the]

[First section, columns 1 to 13, not translated.16]
The plum painted by Fulei possesses: a special and unique air that captures the noble
character of the plum; a bold and solitary prominence that captures the essential spirit of
the plum; and a mood of tranquil detachment that captures the vital resonance of the plum.
Gazing upon such a [masterpiece of] ink painting, one knows that he was indeed one of the
divine immortals. The various inscriptions and colophons also have a [sense of] antique
dignity, and there is nothing of the quotidian about them. It is, as Kong Zhigui
[547–501] said, an object ―that stands outside of things, erect and tall.‖17 This handscroll
later came into the imperial household of the Qing dynasty, and in the upper right portion
of the painting, Emperor Gaozong [Qianlong] personally inscribed a quatrain of
sevencharacter lines ―using the original rhymes [of the artist’s poem] on the picture.‖
Below his poem is a seal reading, Qianlong chenhan [Personally brushed by Qianlong],
and altogether there are nine imperial collector seals of Qianlong and Jiaqing, the two
emperors who viewed [the painting]. In the Shiqu baoji sanbian [third catalogue of the
imperial collection], it is catalogued as ―superior class, celestial first grade.‖18 It has an
outer wrapper of brocade, and a white jade fastening pin carved [on one side] with a
stylized kraken, and incised on the interior with eleven characters in clerical script that
read: ―[Inscribed with] imperial poem by the Qianlong emperor: A Breath of Spring, by
Zou Fulei.‖ In spring during the third month in the third year of the Republic [1914],
while I was recuperating from an illness at the French hospital in the capital [Beijing], a
friend brought this scroll and offered it to me for sale. The asking price was quite
exorbitant, but when I unrolled the scroll to have a look, I fell in love and could not bear
to part with it. Upon inquiry, I learned that the scroll had belonged to Madame Scholar
Miao Suyun [Miao Jiahui, 1842–1918] from Yunnan.19 The Madame Scholar was an
excellent painter of studies from nature in the [tenth-century] styles of Xu Xi and Huang
Quan. During the Guangxu reign period [1875–1908], she was summoned to serve at the
imperial court as a companion to the Empress Dowager Cixi [1835–1908], and because of
her mastery in painting, she was treated with great favor. This scroll must have been 
presented to her by the empress dowager, so I was told, and consequently I purchased it at
the heavy asking price. I have looked systematically through the calligraphy and painting
catalogues of earlier collectors, and other than this scroll there are no extant works by
Zou Fulei. It is a chance ray of light, a lone wisp of a feather drifting down through the
forest of art; over hundreds of years, only this [one] magnificent work has survived. Just
like the handscroll Plum Blossoms by Wang Yansou of the Northern Song dynasty that I
have [also] acquired, it is unique in all the world.20 Wang’s handscroll is painted on silk
with the flowers left in white, while this scroll is painted on paper with the flowers done
in ink. Both [works] were created by brilliant Daoist masters, and though painted in
different dynasties, they are now joined in the same collection. Having this pair of
treasures in my home, I can gaze at the world with pride. Accordingly, I have recorded
the [relevant] entry from An Lucun’s Moyuan huiguan [catalogue] and attached a few
words [of my own] at the end.21 Autumn of the cyclical year yichou, the fourteenth year
of the Republic [1925], inscribed by Guo Baochang, Shiwu fu, of Fanyang.

Because Songxue [Zhao Mengfu] took service under the [alien regime of the] Yuan
dynasty, all the [other] southern scholars and artists of the time sought official
advancement [under the Yuan as well]. Only Shunju [Qian Xuan] did not walk through
this gate, for he shared the same high resolve as Lanpo and Suonan.8 This handscroll is a
genuine work of the highest quality, and since it also bears an inscribed text by Songxue,

Shunju’s [Qian Xuan’s] moral integrity was very lofty. The distinctive characteristics of
his painting most often appeared when he was slightly drunk with wine, but where he
achieved his intent, [his work] is indistinguishable from the ancient masters. In his youth,
Songxue [Zhao Mengfu] once followed him to learn his method of painting, and since the
scroll also bears an inscription by Songxue, it can be seen that this was indeed a joint
creation made during their lifetimes. Nanyunzhai [Mianyi].

Wang Shen of the Song dynasty, with the courtesy name Jinqing, was a native of Taiyuan
[Shanxi Province]. A capable poet and skilled painter, he married the Princess of Shu, a
daughter of Emperor Yingzong [reigned 1064–67], and was made the Defense
Commissioner of Lizhou. For landscape, he studied [the pure-ink style of] Li Cheng, and
[his works] were clean and fluid and quite lovely, but he also painted landscapes in color,
for which he took General Li of the Tang dynasty as his master.3 Neither antique nor
modern, he created a [landscape] style of his own. For painting bamboo in ink, he took
Wen [Tong] of Huzhou as his master.4 — [Quoted] from the Tuhui Baojian [Precious

余嘗讀杜工部《畫馬讚》云：「良工惆悵，落筆雄才」，未嘗不歎世之畫者難其人也。晉唐而
下，姑未暇論，至如近代趙文敏公書畫，俱造神妙。今觀此圖，後復題曰，「雖不能逼近古人
，氣韻有得」，非公誇言，真妙品也。好事者其慎保諸。吳龍門山樵良琦，寓玉峰遠綠軒題，
時為洪武十有七年秋七月十九日也。
I have read the Encomium for a Painted Horse by Du of the Ministry of Works [Du Fu, 712–
770], which says, ―Even the best craftsmen feel disconsolate and downcast / At the consummate
skill with which he brings down his brush,‖ and never fail to sigh at how hard it is [to find] such a
man among the painters of the world.6
I will not waste any time discussing [artists from] the Jin
and Tang dynasties on down, but when it comes to recent times and the painting and calligraphy
of Duke Zhao Wenmin [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322], every work he has created is divine and
marvelous. Having now seen this picture and the inscription he added at the end, which says, 
―Though I cannot approach the ancient masters, I have somewhat captured the essential spirit
[of the animals],‖ [I agree that] these were not [merely] boastful words by the Duke, for it truly is
a marvelous work. Those with an appreciation for such things should take special care to
preserve [this painting]. Inscribed by The Mountain Woodcutter of Dragon Gate, Liangqi from
Wu [Suzhou], while residing in the Pavilion of Distant Green at Jade Peak7
; the date is the
nineteenth day of the seventh lunar-month during autumn in the seventeenth year of the Hongwu
reign period [August 6, 1384].

At right are the Pavilion Letters in ten volumes. In the jiachen year of the Zhizheng reign
period [1364], I acquired them from Mister Jin of Longjiang. Mister Jin acquired them
from Mister Deng of Wumen. Mister Deng acquired them from Lord Zhou Mi [1232–
1298], [known as] Caochuang and Gong[jin], and they must have been owned by minister
Jia Sidao [1213–1275], both of whom left seal impressions, as [seen] at the left [end of
the rubbing]. I had two editions [of the Model Letters] in my personal collection and this
is one of them. The other was seized and taken away by an enthusiast; however, it had
sustained considerable damage at the front and did not have the pristine quality of this
edition. But since everyone has the same liking for pure things, I fear that someone, who
is as fiercely passionate [about such rubbings] as I, will come again and take it away. 
Thus I am writing [the proof of my ownership] on the reverse side of the rubbing where a
[person] looking through will begin. On the full moon [fifteenth day] of the seventh lunarmonth in the yisi year [August 2, 1365], recorded by Zhou Yizai of Jinyun.

右祕閣舊帖十卷。余得之龍江金氏，金氏得之吳門鄧氏，鄧氏得之草窗周密公謹，
蓋賈相似道家故物也。余性喜書，所蓄古帖有二本，此其一焉。其一乃碧瀾趙公所
藏也。經營廿餘年，然後兩帖始合於[一][余]

，把玩未久，趙帖被好事有力者持之而
去，余至今猶追思之，不可得矣。然以兩帖楮墨校之，趙墨固差勝，而楮不迨玆帖
遠甚，況其卷首多殘缺，又不若玆帖之完美也。嘗聞尤物足以移人，若斯帖者，豈
非移人之尤者乎？余雖篤好而秘藏之，政恐酷好如我者復襲之而去，故著其閱歷之
自於斯帖之陰，以見吾得之之難，庶幾後人承覽於我者，毋易失也。至正廿五年龍
集乙已七月既望，縉雲周厚以載跋。

At right are the Pavilion Letters in ten volumes. I acquired them from Mister Jin of
Longjiang. Mister Jin acquired them from Mister Deng of Wumen. Mister Deng acquired
them from Caochuang Zhou Mi [1232–1298], [with the courtesy name] Gongjin, and they
must be one of the things formerly owned by minister Jia Sidao [1213–1275]. By nature,
I enjoy calligraphy and collected two editions of these ancient rubbings, this being one of
them. The other edition had been owned by Master Zhao Bilan [Zhao Youzhi, mid- to
late 13th century]. Only after building up [my collection] for more than twenty years did I
[manage to] bring together the two [sets of] rubbings, but I didn’t have very long to enjoy
them, for the ex-Zhao rubbings were seized by a powerful enthusiast and taken away, and
though I still think back to them to this day, there is nothing that I can do [to reclaim
them]. Still, in comparing the paper and ink of the two sets of rubbings, the ink of the
Zhao rubbings was certainly a bit better, while [the quality of] the paper did not come up
to this version by far, and moreover it had sustained considerable damage at the front and
did not have the pristine quality of this edition. I have heard that special things can move
people, so how could something like these rubbings not be especially moving to them?
Although I sincerely love and treasure them, I fear that someone who is as fiercely
passionate [about such rubbings] as I, will raid me again and take them away. Thus I am
writing on the reverse side of the rubbing where a [person] looking through will begin, in
order to show the problems I have had in acquiring them, or at least so that I will not
easily lose them in the future to someone who gets to see them from me. On the day after
full moon [the sixteenth day] of the seventh lunar-month in the yisi year of the Jupiter
cycle, the twenty-fifth year of the Zhizheng reign period [August 3, 1365], colophon by

余昔在上書房，得見內府所藏宋太宗賜畢士安本，此本楮墨正與相似。嘉慶庚午四
月七日，商丘陳伯恭先生携此本，與賈似道重摹初拓本同見視，蓋賈本從此本出無

角封」，《清河書畫舫》謂「屈角封大幾二寸」。今此印以乾隆六年工部庫校準營
造尺度之，僅一寸四分強。然非偽也，則宋三司尺小於今工部尺一寸三分弱，故也

Long ago when I was [serving] in the private study of His Highness, I got to see the
edition [of the Model Letters from the Chunhua Pavilion] in the imperial collection that
Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty [reigned 976–97] presented to Bi Shi’an [938–
1005], and the paper and ink of this edition resemble it exactly. On the seventh day of the
fourth lunar-month in the gengwu year of the Jiaqing reign period [May 9, 1810], Mister
Chen Bogong [Chen Chongben, see colophon 3] of Shangqiu brought along this edition, 
and we looked at it together with the edition that Jia Sidao [1213–1275] copied from the
original rubbings. As there is no doubt that Jia’s edition derived from this one, there is no
doubt that this is indeed a first edition [of the rubbings]. And as there is not a scintilla of
difference between the dimensions and placement of the ―bent-corner seal‖ reproduced at
the end of Volume 10 in Jia’s edition, and the ―bent-corner seal‖ in relief script in this
edition, there is also no doubt, then, that this edition was indeed owned by [Jia] Sidao. In
the Gujin fashu yuan [Garden of Model Calligraphy Past and Present], a notation under
shenxian records that ―Master Jia [Sidao] used a crooked-corner seal,‖ while the Qinghe
shuhua fang [Clear River Boat of Painting and Calligraphy] says that ―the bent-corner
seal is nearly two cun [inches] in size.‖10 Now if we measure this seal using the yingzaochi
[foot measure] calibrated by the Ministry of Works in the sixth year of the Qianlong reign
period [1741], it is just over one cun [inch] and four fen [tenths]. So, if [the seal] is not
fake, then [the discrepancy] exists because the sansichi [foot measure] of the Song dynasty
was a little under one cun and three fen smaller than the [current] Ministry of Works foot
measure. The edition [of the Model Letters] carved on date wood by the Office of Palace
Maintainance of Three Mountains Palace(?), such as the one in my collection, is far from
this, indeed! Recorded by Prince Cheng.

The nanny of Wang Xianzhi of Langya had the surname Li, the given name Yiru, and was a
native of Guanghan. While still at her home, she was lofty and cultivated in both mind and deed,
and when she came to the Wang family, she was compliant, obedient, respectful, and diligent.
She was skilled at prose composition, able to write in cursive script, and could explicate the
meaning of Buddhist and Daoist texts. At the age of seventy, during the third year of Xingning
when the year-star was in yichou, on the sixth day of the second lunar-month [March 14, 365],
she passed away without illness, and [on the day after the full moon in the jimao month (March
24) was laid to rest] below [Huangfang] Ridge [in Shanyin, Guiji county].1 She was buried with
a small inkstone having a meandering stream [design], and a square bronze vase with
intertwining dragons. Two cypresses were planted at her grave and a memorial stone was erected 
in her honor. Alas, how sad! But eight hundred years hence and more, it shall still be known that
Xianzhi's nanny lies interred in this ground.

It was not until the guihai year in the Jiatai reign period of Emperor Ningzong of the Song
dynasty [1203] that the tomb brick [bearing the Epitaph for] My Nanny first appeared in the
world. Its text has the seemingly prescient phrase ―eight hundred years and more,‖ which Zhou
Bida [1126–1204] also mentions once in his Collected Works of Flat Garden.
4 But as we all
know, there is a destiny to the handing down of famous works, so there is certainly nothing to
wonder about [in this]. Dong Xiangguang [Dong Qichang, 1555–1636] copied [the rubbing] into
his Xihongtang tie [Manuscripts from the Hall of the Playful Goose], but although later followers
of the calligrapher know the writing, original rubbings [from the actual brick] are exceptionally
rare. 5 Now We have acquired this [rubbing], which is precisely the version collected by
Xiangguang [see colophon 4], and although it may not actually be a rubbing from the Jin dynasty
as he says, it certainly cannot be doubted that the Grand Minister [Wang Xianzhi] personally
wrote on the brick, which then was carved by a Jin contemporary. Song Qianqi [Song Lian,
1310–1381] believed the Lanting [Orchid Pavilion] carved into stone was a tracing copy [of the
original] made during the Tang dynasty. This is certainly a winning argument and should be
taken as settled opinion, so all the analysis [to the contrary] by Jiang Yaozhang [Jiang Kui, ca.
1155–ca. 1221] turns out to be simply a big waste of words.6 Inscribed by the Emperor with
candle in hand on the evening before New Year's Eve in the gengwu year of the Qianlong reign
period [January 25, 1751].7

I previously owned this [copy of] the Epitaph for My Nanny, but Guo Youzhi [Guo Tianxi, see
colophon 5] kept after me asking for it, until I finally gave it to him to stop, and never thought
I’d see it again fifteen years later. Although the Epitaph for My Nanny was discovered quite late,
nevertheless it was carved while the Grand Minister [Wang Xianzhi] was healthy [and alive], and
is worth a million of those [other works] passed down in the world that were copied onto stone.

It is already quite rare for a calligrapher to acquire a rubbing done in the Song dynasty, and how
much more so, a rubbing from the Tang! So who knew that a rubbing from the Jin dynasty, such
as the Epitaph for My Nanny, might even exist? It reappeared eight hundred years after Wang
Zijing [Wang Xianzhi] carved it, and after another six hundred years, fell into my hands. [It
makes] all that disputation during the Song dynasty about the Dingwu Purification Text seem
like just a lot of bother!10

At right is the Epitaph for My Nanny written by the Jin dynasty Grand Preceptor and Minister of
the Secretariat, Wang Xianzhi, who had the courtesy name Zijing. In the ninth lunar-month of
the jichou year in the Zhiyuan reign period [September 16–October 15, 1289], I received it from
Zhao [Mengfu, 1254–1322], [vice minister] in the Ministry of War. When Zi’ang [Zhao Mengfu]
arrived in Hang[zhou] and compared it with other versions [of the rubbing], [he found that] it
was very different. But while I am not much given to oral disputation, anyone who has a
profound understanding of Wang’s calligraphy will be able to know it [is genuine]. In the text, I
love the characters shi [family], yu [at], shi [stone], and yu [in], and I have copied and practiced 
them for three years without getting a single one to look quite right. So truly impossible, is it not,
to achieve [the level of] the ancients! On the day of the summer solstice in the renchen year
[June 14, 1292], colophon by Xi.12
When he cut the precious Orchid Pavilion into stone,
It is said that Shuaigeng lost much of the original.13
Until today, real and fake are tangled in confusion,
So I strive to copy what Wang himself put on stone.
In his nanny’s epitaph from eight hundred years ago,
The calligraphy of Xianzhi looks like that of Xizhi.
By the hundred damaged words upon this broken tablet,
Above both Ou and Yan, he is the master for all time.14

The calligraphy of Wang Xizhi [ca. 303–ca. 361] of the Jin dynasty entered the divine. As he
transmitted it all to Xianzhi, whose brushwork was just like his, could there have been some
special secret [of the art] that was transmitted hand to hand within the family? If not, then why
has there been no one over the past thousand years who is able to be like them? Since the advent
of the [Yuan] dynasty, only Zhao Zi’ang [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322] of Wuxing studied ancient
[styles of] calligraphy, and assembled many [rubbings] of stele engravings from the Zhou, Qin,
Han, and Jin dynasties [carved in] seal, clerical, standard, and cursive script. That he became
famous in his time for good calligraphy owed much indeed to the broad knowledge he had
acquired of antiquity, and in his own calligraphy, he developed a unique personal style. [Wang]
Xianzhi’s Epitaph for My Nanny is the quintessence of calligraphy, and genuine versions such as
this cannot often be found. From the Xingning reign period [363–66] it lay concealed in a dark
grave, yet its text already foretold that it would re-emerge eight hundred years later. Starting
from Zi’ang [Zhao Mengfu], this rubbing has now changed hands four times until coming to
Gong Benli [unidentified] of Yuzhang. Whether an ancient object disappears or survives, each 
certainly has its own destiny. Xianzhi composed a tomb record and predicted the appointed times
of its appearance and disappearance, so could it be that this god of calligraphy was also the god
of destiny? On the twentieth day of the sixth lunar month in the seventeenth year of the Zhizheng

―Encomium to harmonize with Guo Youzhi’s [poem] on the Epitaph for My Nanny”
[Poem not translated].
The text of the Grave Stele for Cao E, by Inner Gentleman [of the Left] Cai [Yong, 133–192],
says, ―after three hundred years the stele and grave mound shall collapse into the river.‖ And
here the Record of My Nanny says, ―eight hundred years hence and more, it shall still be known
that
Xianzhi's nanny lies interred in this ground.‖ Oh, how the appearance or disappearance of a
divine object is [governed by] the destiny that lies within it! While we cannot know if the carved
text that has been passed down originated from the Grand Minister’s hand, [the way its writing]
―conceals the point and hides the edge‖ is very much in the style of seal script [practiced] during
the Han [bce 206–220 ce] and Wei [220–265] dynasties. Just touching it in the darkness of night,
I know that it is one level up from the [calligraphy of] the Dingwu [version of the Orchid
Pavilion]. The literary text also has an antique simplicity and is exceptionally beautiful. Passing
from Zhao Songxue [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322] down to the present, every collector without
exception was in his time a famous [master of] ink. How could [such a thing] be easy to obtain?

《太上老君說常清靜經》老君曰：大道無形，生育天地。大道無情，運行日月。大道無名
，長養萬物。吾不知其名，強名曰道。夫道者，有清有濁，有動有靜。天清地濁，天動地
靜。男清女濁，男動女靜。降本流末，而生萬物。清者，濁之源。靜者，動之基。人能常
清靜，天地悉皆歸夫人。神好清而心擾之，心好靜而欲牽之。常能遣其欲而心自靜，澄其
心而神自清。自然六欲不生，三毒消滅。所以不能者，為心未澄，欲未遣也。能遣之者，
內觀其心，心無其心；外觀其形，形無其形；遠觀其物，物無其物。三者既悟，唯見於空
。觀空亦空，空無所空。
所空既無，無無亦無。無無既無，湛然常寂。寂無所寂，欲豈能生。欲既不生，即是真靜
。真常應物，真常得性。常應常靜，常清靜矣。如此清靜，漸入真道。既入真道，名為
得道。雖名得道，實無所得。為化眾生，名為得道。能悟之者，可傳聖道。
老君曰 : 上士無爭，下士好爭。上德不德，下德執德。執著之者，不名道德。眾生所以，
不得真道者，為有妄心。既有妄心，即驚其神。既驚其神，即著萬物。既著萬物，即生貪
求。既生貪求，即是煩惱。煩惱妄想，憂苦身心。便遭濁辱，流浪生死。常沈苦海，永 2
失真道。真常之道，悟者自得。得悟之者，常清靜矣。《太上老君說常清靜經》。
仙人葛玄曰 : 吾得真道，嘗誦此經萬遍。此經是天人所習，不傳下士。吾昔受之於東華帝
君，東華帝君受之於金闕帝君，金闕帝君受之於西王母，皆口口相傳，不記文字。吾今於
世，書而錄之。上士悟之，昇為天官。中士悟之，南宮列仙。下士悟之，在世長年。遊行
三界，昇入金門。
左玄真人曰 : 學道之士，持誦此經萬遍，十天善神，衛護其人，玉符保身，金液鍊形，形
神俱妙，與道合真。
正一真人曰 : 家有此經，悟解之者，災障不生，眾聖護門，神昇上界，朝拜高尊，功滿德
就，想感帝君，誦持不退，身騰紫雲。

The Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquility Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao
Lord Lao said: The Great Dao has no form, yet gave birth to heaven and earth. The Great Dao
has no feelings, but set the sun and the moon in their orbits. The Great Dao has no name, yet it
nurtures the ten-thousand things. Since I do not know its name, I am forced to call it the Dao.
The Dao has both the pure and the turbid, has both movement and tranquility. Heaven is pure
and the earth turbid. Heaven moves and earth is tranquil. Males are pure and females turbid.
Males move and females are tranquil. From root to tip, [these opposites] produce the tenthousand things. Purity is the well-spring of turbidity. Tranquility is the foundation of
movement. If one is constantly pure and tranquil, all of heaven and earth will revert to him. The
spirit loves purity, but the mind disturbs it; the mind loves tranquility, but desires pull at it.
[Therefore] if one is constantly able to banish his desires, the mind will naturally be tranquil; and
if one quiets the mind, the spirit will naturally be pure…. The Scripture of Constant Purity and
Tranquility Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao. 4
The Immmortal Ge Xuan [164–244] said: I achieved the Perfect Dao upon chanting this scripture
ten-thousand times. This scripture is for the practice of celestial individuals and not transmitted
to inferior gentlemen. Long ago, I received it from the Lord Emperor Eastern Effulgence, and the
Lord Emperor Eastern Effulgence received it from the Lord Emperor Golden Portal, and the
Lord Emperor Golden Portal received it from the Queen Mother of the West, which was
transmitted orally from one to the other and not put down in written words. I have now in this
age recorded it in writing. When the superior gentleman is enlightened by it, he will ascend and
become a celestial official. When the average gentleman is enlightened by it, he will join the
ranks of immortals in the Southern Palace. When the inferior gentleman is enlightened by it, he
will live to great age in the mundane world. And wandering freely in these Three Realms, they
will [each] ascend through the Golden Gate.
The Perfected One of the Left Mystery said: If a gentleman who studies the Dao holds fast to
reciting this scripture ten-thousand times, the benevolent dieties of the Ten Heavens will guard
and defend such a person, jade talismans shall protect his body and elixers of gold transmute his
body, and when his body and spirit are both made subtle, they shall merge with the Dao in
perfection.
The Perfected One of Perfect Unity said: If one has this scripture and he is enlightened and
released by it: Calamity will be blocked and not occur, for all the sages shall defend his gate; His
spirit shall ascend to the supreme realm and make obeisance to the High and Venerable; Filled
with merit and accomplished in virtue, his thoughts shall be moved by the Lord Emperor; And
holding fast to chanting [it] without retreat, his body shall mount unto the purple clouds.

趙文敏公好書道經，散在名山甚眾，此其一焉。而王右軍法書流傳於世，唯《黃庭》為稱
首。今觀趙公所書《清靜經》， 飄飄然若蛻骨為仙，凌厲霞表，前輩所稱右軍『灑素寫
道經，筆精妙入神』，同歸此意，宜矣。至正四年五月十六日，題於杭州河南王第之西樓

Duke Zhao Wenmin [Zhao Mengfu] loved to write Daoist scriptures, many of which were
dispersed among famous mountains, and this [text] is one of them. Now, of all the calligraphic
works by Wang of the Army of the Right [Wang Xizhi, ca. 303–ca. 361] that have passed down
through the ages, it is his [transcription of the] Yellow Courtyard [Scripture] that is praised as
best.6 Today I viewed the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility, which was written by Duke Zhao
in so light and airy manner—as if he had shed his bones and become an immortal soaring
fearlessly beyond the rosy clouds—that it would be appropriate, indeed, to apply to him the same
praise of youjun [Wang Xizhi] expressed by former generations: ―Splashing the silk and writing
Daoist scripture, / the spirit of his brushwork entered the divine.‖7 Sixteenth day in the fifth
