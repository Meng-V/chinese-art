Old Trees, Level Distance by Guo Xi
郭熙《樹色平遠》

Colophons

1. Feng Zizhen 馮子振 (1257–after 1327), 11 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 3 seals:
Layered mists and dense fog obscure storied pavilions;
Many sandy islets overlook the desolate expanse.
The old tree's spirit will last a thousand years;
The moist washes and the manner [of the trees] are as enduring as metal and rock.
Amid the duckweed of misty islands, skiffs moor for the night,
And still along the cold river bamboo grows.
Of the honorable Guo [Xi]’s [paintings of] level vistas, few remain.
How treasured the master-painter's works should be![2]
[Signed] Haisu (Feng Zizhen) [Seals]: Zizhen, Haisu, Guaiguai Daoren
煙層霧鬱迷樓閣，沙嶼欹欹俯寒莫。
老髯韻度閱千年，潤姿偃蹇金石堅。
蘋洲小艇爭雲宿，尚有滄江留水竹。
郭郎平遠今無多，畫師珍重奈爾何。
海粟 [印]：子振、海粟、怪怪道人

2. Zhao Mengfu 趙孟頫 (1254–1322), 3 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 1 seal:
Tall mountains and flowing rivers fill the world,
Aspiring to draw them with water and ink is difficult.
My whole life I have followed the lofty message of forests and steams;[3]
Constrained by petty official duties, I have been unable to achieve it.
[Signed] Zi’ang (Zhao Mengfu) [Seal]: Zhao shi Zi’ang
山峙川流宇宙間，欲將水墨寫應難。
平生高步林泉意，苦縛微官未可攀。
子昂 [印]：趙氏子昂

3. Yu Ji 虞集 (1272–1348), 3 columns in standard script, undated:
A white stone, rinsed in water, is even cleaner,
A green pine, grasping the clouds, appears still taller.
So I ask on this painting by master Guo,
How is Mr. Shi Donggao?
Inscribed by Yu Ji.
白石漱水彌潔，青松遞雲轉高。
為問郭公畫裏，何如施氏東皋。
虞集題。

4. Ke Jiusi柯九思 (1290–1343), 3 columns in semi-cursive script, undated:
Guo Xi's brush method derives from Yingqiu (Li Cheng, 919-967).
But his [depictions of] old trees and empty pavilions grew more profound as he grew older.
[Seeing this painting,] I recall once while crossing a bridge over a stream in search of a recluse,
The weak slanting rays [of the setting sun] turned the distant mountains autumnal.
Composed by Ke Jiusi.
郭熙筆法出營丘，古木空亭老更幽。
記得溪橋曾訪隱，斜陽澹澹遠山秋。
柯九思賦。

5. Liu Guan柳貫 (1270–1342), 3 columns in standard script, undated; 1 seal:
Guo Xi was good at painting the mountains in the Luonan region [south of Luoyang, in Henan Province]
His achievement is comparable to that of Jing Hao (active ca. 900-30) and Guan Tong (active ca. 907-23).
This small pavilion on the turtle-back [hummock] suits me well,
Leaning on the railing at the time of parting [I hope] the crane will fly back again.
[Signed] Liu Guan [Seal]: Liu shi Daochuan

柳貫 [印]：柳氏道傳

6. Yen Yaohuan顏堯煥 (14th c.), 12 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 3 seals:
Su Shi [1037–1101] once wrote the poem:
In Jade Hall, dawn is shaded even on an idle spring day,
within there is Guo Xi's painting of spring mountains.
Now Wen Yanbo, the Duke of Lu, had written a colophon on a painting by Guo Xi, and then Old Su Shi had composed a poem after this colophon. These two gentlemen were brilliant and famous officials of their time, but to be able to see such inscriptions nowadays-it is no longer possible! More than one painting by Guo Xi exists, however: take time to examine this Autumn Trees in a Level Distance [as he called Old Trees, Level Distance]. Its materials are from between the Baoyuan [1038-39] and the Yuanyou [1086-93] eras, now returned to the Route Commander Old Shi Donggao's writing table after three hundred years. Old Dong has obtained that which is rarely obtained; this painting has also encountered that which is rarely encountered; I too am able to see that which is rarely seen. For this reason I write him this poem in remembrance:
The fascination of Guo Xi's painting lies not in its colors,
white rocks, withered rafts pillowed by the currents.
This level distance contains sentiments in its illusory lands,
its inscriptions enhance our distance from the past.
On a single layer of white silk, clouds astir and flowing,
for three hundred years and more, the stars have made several revolutions.
Holding [the scroll] with Donggao, we often spread it out in appreciation,
together with our lutes and books, we happily roam.[4]
[Signed] Yan Yaohuan [Seals]: Yan Yaohuan zhang, Mingke, Jingxue

昔東坡有詩“玉堂晝掩春日閑，中有郭熙畫春山。”蓋文潞公嘗跋其畫，而坡老則詩其跋也。二公昭代名臣重望，其品題豈得哉。郭圖在人間不一。今此《樹色平遠圖》，以時攷之，料亦寶元、元祐間所作，於今三百載，而歸于揔管東皐施翁書几，皐翁得所罕得，圖亦遇所罕遇，余亦見所罕見，故為之書而繫之詩：
郭圖妙處不在色，白石枯槎枕洑流。
平遠有情含幻境，品題增重自前脩。
一重素絹雲飛動，三百餘年星幾周。
持向東皐時展玩，琴書相伴樂清遊
顏堯煥 [印]：顏堯煥章、明可、敬學

7. Zuming 祖銘 (1280–1358), 8 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1350; 2 seals:
I respect and adore Guo Xi's paintings;
Their marvels rival that of Creation.
His cloudy mountains appear pale and subtle,
His waters and objects are both still.
From the pavilion atop the sea-turtle's peak,
A myriad realms are gleaned from a single glance.
Opening the scroll, my pleasure never wanes;
Making this poem enhances my perfect tranquility.
On the fifteenth of the tenth lunar month of the gengyin year of the Zhizheng reign era (Nov. 14, 1350), Dingweng, Zuming from Jingshan [near Hangzhou] [inscribed]. [Seals]: Miaoxi wushi, Siming yingguding Zuming baocang
我愛郭熙畫，妙與造化侔。

鰲峰峰上亭，萬境一目收。

8. Wang Shizhen王世貞 (1526–1590), 11 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 2 seals:
At right is Guo Xi's handscroll painting Old Trees, Level Distance. Xi was a
native of Wen [district] in Heyang [Henan Province]. His fellow clansman [Guo] Ruoxu
[active ca. 1070s) described him as ""ingenious and manifold in display as he is
profound in composition. Although he has repeatedly studied and followed Yingqiu (Li Cheng, 919-967), he is also capable of expressing [what lies within]
his own breast. His huge screens and high walls are a multitude in which each is
more virile [than its predecessor].""[5] The Xuanhe Emperor [i.e. Huizong, r.
1101-25], however, praised only Li Cheng and said of [Guo] Xi, Fan Kuan (active
ca. 990-1030) and Wang Shen (ca. 1046-after 1100) that although they each
established a reputation, they each only attained one aspect [of Li Cheng]. Among
the paintings attributed to [Guo] Xi handed down in the world today, most are
called ""level vista."" This is different from what [Guo] Ruoxu recorded. I once
acquired a scroll by Dai Wenjin (Dai Jin, 1388-1462) done in the manner of
[Guo] Xi. I especially loved it and often placed it on my desk for the pleasure of
making daydream excursions. Now, viewing this painting, I finally realize that
[Dai] Wenjin still had traces of craftsmanship. The lonely pavilion and dying trees,
the boundless flat expanse, the distant boat and little bridge, each at times sheds
its luster, now deep, now shallow, sometimes dark, sometimes bright. It makes me
want to place myself inside [the painting]. [Dai] Wenjin is three stages [behind
Guo Xi]. At the end of the scroll are [inscriptions by] Zhao Songxue (Zhao Mengfu), Yu Daoyuan (Yu Ji), Feng Haisu (Feng Zizhen), Ke Danqiu (Ke Jiusi) and that generation. All are famous scholars of the preceding dynasty. Regrettably, their words do not fit
perfectly with the painting. Wang Shizhen from the Wu Prefecture inscribed. [Seals]: Wang Yuanmei yin, Tiantao Jushi
右郭熙《樹色平遠圖》一卷，按熙河陽溫人，渠宗若虛稱其“施為巧瞻，位置淵深，雖復學慕營丘，亦能自放胸臆，巨障高壁多多益壯。”至宣和帝則盛推李成，而謂熙與范寬、王詵雖自成名，僅得一體。然熙之傳世者多號平遠，與若虛所記頗不同。余嘗得戴文進倣熙巻，絕愛之，時置几案間，以當臥遊之樂。今覽此畫，乃知文進尚有蹊徑也。孤亭木末，平楚蒼然，遙艇小橋，時自映帶，若深若淺，或晦或明，幾欲置身此間，文進三舍矣。巻尾趙松雪、虞道園、馮海粟、柯丹丘輩皆勝國名士，恨語不甚稱耳。吳郡王世貞題。 [印]：王元美印、天弢居士

9. Chen Yan 陳演 (died 1644), 1 column in clerical script, undated; 1 seal:
Chen Yan from Yingchuan [in Henan Province] with Huang Renfu and Yao Dayou respectfully
viewed this at Qingxi by the Great [Yangzi] River. [Seal]: Daoyi shi

10. Zhang Daqian 張大千 (1899–1983), 2 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1955; 2 seals:
Guo Heyang's (Guo Xi) Old Trees, Level Distance, a supreme rarity, respectfully cherished in the Dafeng Tang Studio.

And year after year the river flows futilely into the Eastern Sea.

Yan Cungeng [Yan Geng] lived in the Southern Song dynasty [1127–1279], whose paintings are rarely seen.

In autumn, the eighth lunar month, of the nineteenth year in the yihai year of the Zhizheng reign era [August–September, 1359] I was staying in Wulin [present-day Hangzhou]. Han Jieshi came to me bringing with him a painting of a man and a horse by my late father, the Minister. He told me that Xie Boli, Associate Prefect of Songjiang, sent him to show the picture and ask me to do a painting of the same subject as a sequel to it. I viewed it respectfully with mingled feelings of sorrow and joy and could not put it down. Although I am not personally acquainted with Boli, since I admire his lofty spirit, I painted this with profound emotion and give it to Jieshi to forward to him. Written by Zhao Yong.[1]

Xie Boli of Yunjian [present-day Songjiang, Jiangsu] for some time owned the painting Man and Horse by my late grandfather, the Duke of Wei, and has had it mounted on a handscroll. Later, at his request my father also executed a painting on the following part of the scroll and now he makes the request of me. May I venture to ask, is it not that he covetously desires works handed down by all three generations of my family? Unless one is most enthusiastic about [art works] of merit, no one would be so attentive to such things. So finally, without declining, I consented to do it.

Master Zhao of Wuxing was respected in the former dynasty for his literary and political accomplishments. At his leisure he delighted himself with brush and ink. The refinement of his calligraphy and painting and the magic of his brushwork, therefore, were among the best under heaven. And his son and grandson were able to continue his aspiration. Mr. Wang Xihe of Qingjiang brought Grooms and Horses, a painting by the three generations of the [Zhao] family in his collection, to show me. Master Ziang [Zhao Mengfu] was the patriarch, Master Zhongmu [Zhao Yong] was the son, and Master Yanjing [Zhao Lin] was the grandson. Seeing them look ahead in attendance and observe the hierarchical order of seniority with deep familial affection, one understands that when the worthies gather their thought to move their brush, even the minor details of a painting confirm to the principles of cosmic order and humanity. When later generations spread out the scroll, filial piety will always fill their mind. In addition, the horses have sinewy tendons, yellowish knees, angular heads, and solid hoofs. Their eyes, in the shape of suspended bells, flash purplish lightening. They are so exquisite and beautiful. Their accessories seem to clank; their eyes seem to glare. They appear ready to fly, solid as they are. They deserve the emperor’s stable; the chariots’ bells ring [as they move]. Bole (7th c. B.C.) would not have needed Jiufang Gao (7th c. B.C.) to discern their [superiority]. Xihe is born of an illustrious family, always keen on upholding the principle of propriety. More and more elders of the community come to sing his praises. He is like a steed of natural virtue that is also well provided for. In the future when he enters the emperor’s stable and makes the chariot’s bells ring, I will verify his achievement against this painting. Having viewed this scroll, I respectfully wrote after it.

A descendant of the dragon-horse from the Wowa Lake [in Gansu], it has manes like dark jade.

The two horses are no inferior to Han Gan’s (active ca. 742–56).
The former is snow white with continuous coin patterns,
Whose two calves resemble cut jade and the other two look misty.
The latter, peach-colored with raindrop spots,
Has distinct white forehead and unique muscles and bone structure.
Two extraordinary creatures in leisurely manners,
Just like those paraded in the emperor’s stable.
There are innumerable genuine dragon-horses in the world.
Which of them can compete with what is seen here?

Don’t you see, Sir,
Zhao Mengfu of Wuxing is unique in the fields of art and literature.
In the past he painted the horse with his mind,
Which, with bristly manes on a curved body, seems about to run wild.
The brushwork of his wonderful son was even better;
The image he drew far surpassed the steeds from the Wowa Lake.
Its angular, sharp ears resemble a pair of bamboo leaves;
Repeated circular patterns decorated its motley hair.
How fortunate that he had an outstanding grandson to continue the tradition;
One swifter steed was added to the scroll.
Covered with peach-blossom-spots all over,
It amazes people with its marvelous form.
[The painting’s] awesome loftiness is beyond reach,
Remaining in the world for over a hundred years.
Today [Wang] Jun showed me this scroll.
Spreading it out for appreciation by my window, I smile with joy.

A great horse is not valued for its strength, but for its virtue. That is why a great horse is indeed like a gentleman. Tuizhi’s [Han Yu, 768–824] remarks on horses in his “Miscellaneous Essays” reveal profound thought. The Duke of Wei from Wuxing [Zhao Mengfu] had no rival in literary achievement. Though he was skilled at painting, it was not an important pursuit. The reason why he once painted Groom and Horse for Surveillance Commissioner Feiqing must be that Feiqing knew horses well too. The reason why Vice Magistrate Xie Boli, having kept it in his collection for several years, asked the Duke’s son, Yong, and grandson, Lin, to paint in succession must be that Boli was a horse-lover too. I came to Qingjiang to take an editorial position. Mr. Wang Xihe purchased this scroll and showed it to me. I appreciated it for a long while, feeling as if they were real great horses. How could Xihe have done this, had he not cherished elegant things deeply! Ah! As for those horse-loving gentlemen, I know they will certainly be loved themselves.

8. Yuan Heng 袁衡 (active early 15th c.), 22 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1425; 3 seals:

The Grooms and Horses painted by the three generations [of the Zhao Family], acquired by Mr. Wang Xihe living in east Lincheng, used to be in the collection of Vice Magistrate of Yunjian [present-day Songjiang, near Shanghai] Xie Boli. The first section was by Academician Ziang [Zhao Mengfu], which rivals Han Gan’s work. The second one painted by his son, Zhao Yong, attests to the transmission of brushwork. The third by his grandson, Zhao Lin, was especially marvelous. Ah! Despite their different forms, the three horses share the same virtue. Despite their different appearances, the three men are all grooms. They come out of the emperor’s stable and run freely in the wilderness. Neither fettered nor exhausted, they fulfill their nature. All the viewers in the world are amazed, saying that the first one chases the wind and lightening, the second one’s divine spirit surpasses all the others, the last one covers a thousand miles for one gallop, and they are all superior horses. It is indeed so. But do they know about the subtlety of the human mind? Those who paint horses well are not [professional] painters, but dignitaries of the upper class. Although they only play with ink and brush, they all attain an understanding of their subject first, and then respond to it with their hands. Without being particular to hair colors, their portrayals naturally embody the horses’ spirit. Painters, on the other hand, are particular to hair colors. Their paintings, while capturing certain aspects, always lose the others. They are good at a few things, but always weak in handling the others. How can they stand a comparison? Moreover, the father painted it first, followed by his son and grandson. The continuous transmission from fathers to sons is rarely seen in a thousand years. Ah! The transmission of this scroll began with Boli and continued to Xihe, who made [its extraordinariness] manifest. Three horses may symbolize the rank of Three Dukes. Their descendants must someday attain the rank of Three Dukes. Treasure it dearly! It is an omen pointing to the future. I inscribed this with delight. Written on the first of the ninth lunar month in the autumn of the first year of the Hongxi reign era [October 12, 1425] by Confucian School Instructor in the Tribal Office of Yuanjiang in Yunnan Yuan Heng from the same town.

臨城東王氏希和所得三世 《人馬圖》 乃雲間別驾公謝伯理所藏也。一曰子昂學士寫，雖韓榦不讓矣。二曰其子趙雍寫，信其筆勢之有傳也。三曰厥孫趙麟作，寫之妙尤入神矣。噫！三馬異形而同德，三人異貌而同牧，出夫天廄，逸扵雲野，不羈不勞，得夫性之自然也。舉世觀者咸奇之，曰前者追風逐電，次者神駿超羣，後者舉足千里，此皆馬之良者也，不誣矣，抑孰知其人心之妙哉。夫寫馬者，非畫史也，皆金馬玉堂之貴客，雖游戲翰墨，先皆有得於心，然後應之扵手，不拘拘於毛色，而自入於神矣。若夫畫史之畫，拘拘於毛色者，得於彼者，必失於此，長於此者，又必短扵彼，夫豈可倫哉。矧父作扵前，子孫善繼扵後，父子之間，一道相傳，誠千載罕有也。嗟夫！圖之傳始得扵伯理，再傳於希和，表而出之，三馬所以象三公，後世子孫其必有位三公者歟！寳而珍之，其兆必此而張本耳。予喜而識之。洪煕元年秋九月朔日雲南元江軍民府儒學教授同邑袁衡書。 [印]: 稽古之學、筆補造化、竹深處

9. Chen Hongshou 陳洪綬 (1599–1652), 9 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 2 seals:

There are many families which maintained their artistic tradition for three generations, such as the senior and the junior General Li [Li Sixun, active ca. 705 20, and his son Li Zhaodao, active mid-8th c.], the Ma family [Ma Yuan, active ca. 1190-1230, and his son Ma Lin, ca. 1180-after 1256], and the Mi family [Mi Fu, 1052-1107, and his son Mi Youren, 1074-1151]. However, it is nothing but brush and ink. What is more precious is the uninterrupted transmission of moral value and literary achievement from father to son and from grandfather to grandson. This is what I expect to see from Shenweng, whose late father’s posthumous title was Zhonglie. This is what I expect to see from Shenweng. Written by Hongshou at the request of Shenweng.

Inscriptions on the painting[1]

Unidentified artist in the style of the Song emperor Gaozong (r. 1127-1162), in 7 sections:

Section 1 (35 columns in standard script, undated):

In the seventh month the fire ebbs;
In the ninth month I hand out the coats.
In the days of the first [month] sharp frosts;
In the days of the second [month] keen winds.
Without coats, without serge,
How should they finish the year?
In the days of the third [month] they plough;
In the days of the fourth [month] out I step
With my wife and children,
Bringing hampers to the southern acre
Where the field-hands come to take good cheer.

In the seventh month the fire ebbs;
In the ninth month I hand out the coats.
But when the spring days grow warm
And the oriole sings
The girls take their deep baskets
And follow the path under the wall
To gather the soft mulberry-leaves:

In the tenth month the cricket goes under my bed.
I stop up every hold to smoke out the rats,
Plugging the windows, burying the doors:
'Come, wife and children,
The change of the year is at hand.
Come and live in this house.'

In the sixth month we eat wild plums and cherries,
In the seventh month we boil mallows and beans.
In the eighth month we dry the dates,
In the tenth month we take the rice
To make with it the spring wine,
So that we may be granted long life.
In the seventh month we eat melons,
In the eighth month we cut the gourds,
In the ninth month we take the seeding hemp,
We gather bitter herbs, we cut the ailanto for firewood,
That our husbandmen may eat.

In the ninth month we make ready the stackyards,
In the tenth month we bring in the harvest,
Millet for wine, millet for cooking, the early and the late,
Paddy and hemp, beans and wheat.
Come, my husbandmen,
My harvesting is over,
Go up and begin your work in the house,
In the morning gather thatch-reeds,
In the evening twist rope;
'The spring days are drawing out;
They gather the white aster in crowds.
A girl's heart is sick and sad
Till with her lord she can go home.'

I the seventh month the fire ebbs;
In the eighth month they pluck the rushes,
In the silk-worm month they gather the mulberry-leaves,
Take that chopper and bill
To lop the far boughs and high,
Pull towards them the tender leaves.
In the seventh month the shrike cries;
In the eighth month they twist thread,
The black thread and the yellow:
'With my red dye so bright
I make a robe for my lord.'

In the fourth month the milkwort is in spike,
In the fifth month the cicada cries.
In the eighth month the harvest is gathered,
In the tenth month the boughs fall.
In the days of the first [month] we hunt the racoon,
And take those foxes and wild-cats
To make furs for our Lord.
In the days of the second [month] is the great Meet;
Practice for deeds of war.
The one-year-old [boar] we keep;
The three-year-old we offer to our Lord.

In the fifth month the locust moves its leg,
In the sixth month the grasshopper shakes its wing,
In the seventh month, out in the wilds;
In the eighth month in the farm,
In the ninth month, at the door.
Go quickly on to the roofs.
Soon you will be beginning to sow your many grains.

In the days of the second [month] they cut the ice with tingling blows;
In the days of the third [month] they bring it into the cold shed.
In the days of the fourth [month] very early
They offer lambs and garlic.
In the ninth month are shrewd frosts;
In the tenth month they clear the stackgrounds.
With twin pitchers they hold the village feast,
Killing for it a young lamb.
Up they go into their lord's hall,
Raise the drinking-cup of buffalo-horn:
'Hurray for our lord; may he live for ever and ever!'

The Seventh Month

七月

Section 2 (10 columns in standard script, undated):

OH, kite-owl, kite-owl,
You have taken my young.
Do not destroy my house.
With such love, such toil
To rear those young ones I strove!

Before the weather grew damp with rain
I scratched away the bark of that mulberry-tree
And twined it into window and door.
'Now, you people down below,
If any of you dare affront me....'

My hands are all chafed
With plucking so much rush flower;
With gathering so much bast
My mouth is all sore.
And still I have not house or home!

My wings have lost their gloss,
My tail is all bedraggled.
My house is all to pieces,
Tossed and battered by wind and rain.
My only song, a cry of woe!

The Owl

鴟鴞，周公救亂也。成王未知周公之志，公乃為詩以遺王，名之曰鴟鴞焉。鴟鴞鴟鴞，旣取我子，無毀我室。恩斯勤斯，鬻子之閔斯。迨天之未陰雨，徹彼桑土，綢繆牖戶。今女下民，或敢侮予。予手拮据，予所將荼。予所蓄租，予口卒瘏, 曰予未有室家。予羽譙譙，予尾翛翛，予室翹翹，風雨所漂搖，予維音嘵嘵 。
鴟鴞

Section 3 (23 columns in standard script, undated):

I went to the eastern hills;
Long was it till I came back.
Now I am home from the east;
How the drizzling rain pours!
I am back from the east,
But my heart is very sad.
You made for me that coat and gown
'Lest my soldier should go secret ways.'
Restless the silkworm that writhes
When one puts it on the mulberry-bush;
Staunch I bore the lonely nights,
On the ground, under my cart.

I went to the eastern hills;
Long, long was it till I came back.
Now I am home from the east;
How the drizzling rain pours!
The fruit of the bryony
Has spread over the eaves of my house.
There are sowbugs in this room;
There were spiders' webs on the door.
In the paddock were the marks of wild deer,
The light of the watchman glimmers.
These are not things to be feared,
But rather to rejoice in.

I went to the eastern hills;
Long, long was it till I came back.
When I came from the east,
How the drizzling rain did pour!
A stork was crying on the ant-hill;
That means a wife sighing in her chamber.

Eastern Hills

東山，周公東征也。周公東征，三年而歸。勞歸士，大夫美之，故作是詩也。一章言其完也，二章言其思也，三章言其室家之望女也，四章樂男女之得及時也。君子之於人，序其情而閔其勞，所以說也。說以使民， 民忘其死，其唯東山乎！我徂東山，慆慆不歸。我來自東，零雨其濛。我東曰歸，我心西悲。制彼裳衣，勿士行枚。蜎蜎者蠋，烝在桑野。敦彼獨宿, 亦在車下。我徂東山，慆慆不歸。我來自東，零雨其濛。果贏之實，亦施于宇。伊威在室，蠨蛸在戶。町疃鹿場，熠燿宵行。不可畏也，伊可懷也。我徂東山，慆慆不歸。我來自東，零雨其濛。鸛鳴于垤，婦歎于室。洒掃穹窒，我征聿至。有敦瓜苦，烝在栗薪。自我不見，于今三年。 我徂東山，慆慆不歸。我來自東，零雨其濛。倉庚于飛，熠燿其羽。之子于歸，皇駁其馬，親結其縭，九十其儀。其新孔嘉，其舊如之何？
東山

Section 4 (8 columns in standard script, undated):

Broken were our axes
And chipped our hatchets.
But since the Duke of Chou came to the East
Throughout the kingdoms all is well.
He has shown compassion to us people,
He has greatly helped us.

Broken were our axes
And chipped our hoes.
But since the Duke of Chou came to the East
The whole land has been changed.
He has shown compassion to us people,
He has greatly blessed us.

Broken were our axes
And chipped our chisels.
But since the Duke of Chou came to the East
All the kingdoms are knit together.
He has shown compassion to us people,
He has been a great boon to us.

Broken Axes

破斧，美周公也。周大夫以惡四國焉，旣破我斧，又缺我斨。周公東征，四國是皇。哀我人斯，亦孔之將。既破我斧，又缺我錡。周公東征，四國是吪。哀我人斯，亦孔之嘉。既破我斧，又缺我銶。周公東征，四國是遒。哀我人斯，亦孔之休。
破斧

Section 5 (5 columns in standard script, undated):

How does one cut an axe-handle?
Without an axe it is impossible.
How does one take a wife?
Without a matchmaker she cannot be got.

Cut an axe-handle? Cut an axe-handle?
The pattern is not far to seek.
Here is a lady with whom I have had a love-meeting;
Here are my dishes all in a row.

Cutting an Ax Handle

伐柯，美周公也。周大夫刺朝廷之不知也。伐柯如何？匪斧不克。取妻如何？匪媒不得。伐柯伐柯，其則不遠。我覯之子，籩豆有踐。
伐柯

Section 6 (7 columns in standard script, undated):

'The fish in the minnow-net
Were rudd and bream.
The lover I am with
Has blazoned coat and broidered robe.'

'The wild-geese take wing; they make for the island.
The prince has gone off and we cannot find him.
He must be staying with you.

The wild-geese take wing; they make for the land.
The prince went off and does not come back.
He must be spending the night with you.'

'All because he has a broidered robe
Don't take my prince away from me,
Don't make my heart sad.'

Fishnets

Section 7 (6 columns in standard script, undated):

The wolf may catch in its own dewlap
Or trip up upon its tail.
But this nobleman, so tall and handsome,
In his red shoes stands sure.

The wolf may trip upon its tail
Or be caught in its dewlap.
But this nobleman, so tall and handsome--
In his fair fame is no flaw.

The Wolf

狼跋，美周公也。周公攝政，遠則四國流言，近則王不知，周大夫美其不失其聖也。狼跋其胡，載疐其尾。公孫碩膚，赤舃几几。狼疐其尾，載跋其胡。公孫碩膚，德音不瑕。

Artist’s colophon (18 columns in clerical script, dated 1323):

In the Chongning reign era [1102–06], the Jinming [Golden Bright] Lake used to be opened on the third day of the third lunar month and prizes were offered so that the citizens could share its pleasure with the monarch. This is described in detail in the Dreams of the Splendor of the Eastern Capital [Menghua lu by Meng Yuanlao]. In the gengxu year of the Zhida reign era [1310], it happened to be the “Festival of a Thousand Springs” [i.e., the royal birthday] of his imperial highness, the heir-apparent, the future emperor Renzong, when I did a painting depicting this subject for presentation [as a birthday gift]. I inscribed on the painting the following poem:
On the third day of the third lunar month the Golden Bright Pond was bustling with games of the giant dragon boats,
Amidst the thundering applause and cacophony of drumbeats and music.
The aura of joy was radiant as the sun and brightened the flags and banners.
Although the prizes could not be worth much, the river-boys from the Wu District
Were heedless in the height of their ecstasy.
They remind us of all the foolish competitors of the world
Who strive forward by inches and backward by feet.
But what actually counts is the idea of shared pleasures with the entire populace.
For that reason alone, I dare to compose this piece of ‘soundless poetry’ [painting].
The Heir-apparent leads a simple life and indulges himself in no excesses.
In the garden of the arts and the forest of books alone, he enjoys himself with spiritual and visual pleasures.
Today on the occasion of his royal birthday, I respectfully record this for posterity –
As a ‘golden example for the coming thousands of years.’
I respectfully recall that on that occasion Her Imperial Highness, Dazhang Gongzhu [The Grand Elder Princess] had seen my painting. Now, after a lapse of more than twelve year, I am instructed to make another version of the same composition. My eyesight however, is not as good as before. Even though I have tried my best to comply, I am still deeply afraid that the painting is unworthy of presentation for her royal scrutiny. In the late spring of the guihai year of the Zhizhi reign era [1323] Linjiling (In charge of the Granary), Wang Zhenpeng, prostrating himself, respectfully painted and wrote this.[1]

草書廉頗藺相如傳",https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39918,"Huang Tingjian
黃庭堅","Artist's inscription (206 columns in semi-cursive and cursive scripts)

Lian Po was an able general of Zhao. In the sixteenth year of King Huiwen, he commanded the Zhao army against Qi and defeated its troops, taking the city of Jinyang. Then he was made a chief minister and was known for his prowess to all the states.

Lin Xiangru, a man of Zhao, was the steward of Miao Xian, the chief eunuch.

King Huiwen had come into possession of the jade of Bian He, a man of Chu. When King Zhao of Qin knew this he sent an envoy with a letter to the king of Zhao, offering fifteen cities in exchange for the jade, The king took counsel with General Lian Po and his chief ministers, who feared that if the jade were sent to Qin they might be cheated and get no cities in return, yet if they refused, the soldiers of Qin might attack. They could neither hit on a plan nor find an envoy to take their answers to Qin.

Then Miao Xian, the chief eunuch, said, “My steward Lin Xiangru would make a good envoy.”

“How do you know?” asked the king.

He replied, “Once I did something wrong and secretly planned to escape to Yan, but my steward stopped me, asking, ‘How can you be sure of the king of Yan?’ I answered, ‘I met him at the frontier with our king, and he privately grasped my hand and offered me his friendship. That is how I know, and why I mean to go there.’ Lin said, ‘Zhao is strong and Yan is weak, and because you stood well with our lord, the king of Yan desired your friendship. But if you now fly from Zhao to Yan, for fear of Zhao he will not dare to keep you and will have you sent back in chains. Your only possible way out is to bare your shoulder and prostrate yourself before the axe and block for punishment.’ I took his advice and Your Majesty pardoned me. To my mind he is a brave, resourceful man, well fitted to be our envoy.”

The king thereupon summoned Lin Xiangru and asked him, “Should I accept the king of Qin’s offer of fifteen cities in exchange for my jade?”

“Qin is strong. We are weak,” replied Lin Xiangru. “We cannot refuse.”

“What if he takes my jade but will not give me the cities?”

“If we refuse Qin’s offer of cities in exchange for the jade, that puts us in the wrong; but if we give up the jade and get no cities, that puts Qin in the wrong. Of these two courses, the better one is to agree and put Qin in the wrong.”

“Who can be our envoy?”

“If Your Majesty has no one else, I will gladly take the jade and go on this mission. If the cities are given to Zhao, the jade will remain in Qin. If no cities are given, I shall bring the jade back unscathed.”

So the king of Zhao sent Lin Xiangru with the jade west to Qin.

The king of Qin sat in his pleasure pavilion to receive Lin Xiangru, who presented the jade to him. The king, very pleased, had it shown to his ladies and attendants, and all his attendants cheered.

Seeing that the king had no intention of giving any cities to Zhao, Lin Xiangru stepped forward and said, “There is a blemish on the jade. Let me show it to you, sir.”

As soon as the king gave him the jade, Lin Xiangru retreated to stand with his back to a pillar. His hair bristling with fury, he said, “To get this jade, great king, you sent a letter to the king of Zhao. When our sovereign summoned his ministers to discuss the matter, they said, ‘Qin is greedy and, relying on its strength, hopes to get our jade in return for empty promises. We are not likely to receive the cities.’ They were against giving you the jade. It seemed to me, however, that if even fellows in homespun can trust each other, how much more can powerful states. Besides, how wrong it would be to offend mighty Qin for the sake of a piece of jade! So the king of Zhao, after fasting for five days, sent me with a letter and the jade to your court. Why? To show the respect and awe in which we hold your great country. Yet on my arrival you received me in a pleasure pavilion and treated me with contempt. You took the jade and passed it among your ladies to make a fool of me. I can see you have no intention of giving Zhao those cities in return, so I have taken back the jade. If you use force against me, I will smash my head and the jade against this pillar.”

With that, glancing at the pillar, he raised the jade and threatened to smash it.

To save the jade, the king of Qin apologized and begged him to stop, then ordered the officer in charge to look up the map and point out the boundaries of the fifteen cities to be given to Zhao.

Lin Xiangru, thinking this was a subterfuge and that Zhao would never really get the cities, declared, “The jade of Bian He is a treasure known throughout the world, but for the fear of Qin the king of Zhao dared not withhold it. Before parting with it he fasted for five days. So it is only right, great king, that you too should fast for five days and then prepare a grand court reception. Only then dare I hand it over.”

Since he could not seize the jade by force, the king agreed to fast for five days, during which time Lin Xiangru should be lodged in the Guangcheng Hostel.

Lin Xiangru suspected that despite his fast the king would not keep his promise to give the cities. So, dressing one of his followers in rags and concealing the jade on his person, he made him hurry back to Zhao by paths and byways.

When the king of Qin had fasted for five days, he prepared a grand reception for Zhao’s envoy.

Lin Xiangru, arriving, announced to the king, “Since the time of Duke Mu of Qin, not one of the twenty-odd princes of your state had kept faith. Fearful of being deceived by Your Majesty and letting my country down, I sent a man back with the jade. He should be in Zhao by now. Qin is strong and Zhao is weak. When you, great king, sent a single messenger to Zhao, we immediately brought the jade here. If your mighty state had first given us fifteen cities, we should not have dared offend you by keeping the jade. I know I deserve death for deceiving you and beg to be boiled in the cauldron. Consider this well with your ministers, great king!”

The king and all his ministers gaped at each other. Some attendants prepared to drag Lin Xiangru away, but the king said, “Killing him now will not get us the jade but would spoil our relations with Zhao. Better treat him handsomely and send him back. The king of Zhao dare not risk offending Qin for the sake of a piece of jade.”

Thereupon he entertained Lin Xiangru in his court, dismissing him when the ceremony was over.

The king of Zhao was so pleased with the skill with which Lin Xiangru had saved the state from disgrace that he made him a high councilor on his return. Neither did Qin give the cities to Zhao, nor Zhao give the jade to Qin.

After this, (Qin attacked Zhao and took Shicheng.
The following year twenty thousand men of Zhao were killed in another attack. Then the king of Qin sent an envoy to the king of Zhao, proposing a friendly meeting at Mainchi, south of Xihe. The king of Zhao loathed to go, for fear of Qin. But Lian Po and Lin Xiangru reasoned with him saying, “Not to go, sir, would make our country appear weak and cowardly.”
So the king went, accompanied by Lin Xiangru.
Lian Po saw them to the frontier, where he bade the king farewell saying, “I reckon that Your Majesty’s journey there, the meeting and the journey back should not take more than thirty days. If you fail to return in that time, I suggest that we set up the crown prince as king, to thwart the designs of Qin.”

The king, having agreed,) went to meet the king of Qin at Mianchi.

(The king of Qin, merry after drinking, said, “I have heard that the king of Zhao is a good musician. Will you play zither for me?”

The king of Zhao did as he asked. Then the Qin chronicler stepped forward and recorded, “On such-and-such a day the king of Qin drank with the king of Zhao and ordered the king of Zhao to play the zither.”
Lin Xiangru then advanced and said, “The king of Zhao has heard that the king of Qin is a good hand at Qin music. Will you entertain us with a tune on the pitcher?”
The king of Qin angrily refused. But Lin Xiangru went forward to present a pitcher and, kneeling down, requested him to play. Still the king refused.
“I am only five steps from you,” cried Lin Xiangru. “I can bespatter you, great king, with the blood from your throat!”
The attendants wanted to kill him, but he glared and shouted so fiercely that they shrank back. Then the king of Qin sullenly beat once on the pitcher, whereupon Lin Xiangru turned to bid the Zhao chronicler record, “On such-and-such a date, the king of Qin played the pitcher for the king of Zhao.”
Then the ministers of Qin said, “We hope Zhao will present fifteen cities to the king of Qin.”
Lin Xiangru retorted, “We hope Qin will present Xianyang to the king of Zhao!”
At this feast, then, the king of Qin was unable to get the better of Zhao. Nor dared he make any move because of the strong guard brought by the king of Zhao.)

Upon their return to Zhao after this meeting, Lin Xiangru was appointed a chief minister for his outstanding service, taking precedence over Lian Po.

Lian Po protested, “As a general of Zhao I have served the state well in the field and stormed many cities. All Lin Xiangru can do is wag his tongue, yet now he is above me. I’d think shame to work under such a base-born fellow.” He swore, “When I meet Lin Xiangru, I shall humiliate him!”

When Lin Xiangru got word of this, he kept out of Lian Po’s way and absented himself from court on grounds of illness, not wanting to compete for precedence. Once when he caught sight of Lian Po on the distance on the road, he drove his carriage another way.

His stewards reproached him saying, “We left our kingsmen to serve you because we admired your lofty character, sir. Now you have the same rank as Lian Po, but when he insults you in public, you try to avoid him and look abjectly afraid. This would disgrace even a common citizen, let alone generals and ministers! We are afraid we must beg to resign.”

Lin Xiangru stopped them, asking, “Is General Lian Po as powerful in your eyes as the king of Qin?”

“Of course not,” they replied.

“If, useless as I am, I lashed out at the mighty king of Qin in his court and insulted his ministers, why should I be afraid of General Lian Po? To my mind, however, were it not for the two of us, powerful Qin would not hesitate to invade Zhao. When two tigers fight, one must perish. I behave as I do because I put our country’s fate before private feuds.”

When word of this reached Lian Po, he bared his shoulders, fastened a switch of thorns to his back and had a protégé conduct him to Lin Xiangru’s gate. He apologized, “Contemptible boor that I am, I could not understand your magnanimity, sir!”

They became close friends, ready to die for each other.[1]

廉頗者，趙之良將也。趙惠文王十六年，廉頗為趙將伐齊，大破之，取晉陽，拜為上卿，以勇氣聞於諸侯。藺相如者，趙人也，為趙宦者令繆賢舍人。趙惠文王時，得楚和氏壁[壁字點去]璧。秦昭王聞之，使人遣趙王書，願以十五城請易璧。趙王與大將軍廉頗諸大臣謀：欲事[事字點去]與秦，秦城恐不可得，徒見欺；欲勿與，即患秦兵之來。計未定，求人可使報秦者，未得。宦者令繆賢曰：“臣舍人藺相如可使。”王問：“何以知之？”對曰：“臣嘗有罪，竊計欲亡走燕；臣舍人相如止臣，曰：‘君何以知燕王？’臣語曰：‘臣嘗從大王與燕王會境上，燕王私握臣手曰：“願結友”。以此知之，故欲往。’相如謂臣曰：‘夫趙彊而燕弱，而君幸於趙王，故燕王欲結於君。今君乃亡趙走燕，燕畏趙，其勢必不敢留君，而束君歸趙矣。君不如肉袒伏斧質請罪，則幸得脱矣。’臣從其計，大王亦幸赦臣，臣竊以為其人勇士，有智謀，宜可使。”於是王召見，（問）藺相如曰：“秦王以十五城請易寡人之璧，可與不？”相如曰：“秦彊而趙弱，不可不許。”王曰：“取吾璧，不與我城，奈何？”相如曰：“秦以城求璧而趙不與，曲在趙。趙與璧，而秦不與趙城，曲在秦。均之二策，寧與[許]以負秦曲。”王曰：“誰可使者？”相如曰：“王必無人，臣願奉璧往使。城入趙而璧留秦。城不入，臣請完璧歸趙。”趙王於是遂遣相如奉璧西入秦。秦王坐章臺見相如，相如奉璧奏秦王。秦王大喜，傳以示美人及左右，左右皆呼萬歲。相如視秦王無意還[還字點去]償趙城，乃前曰：“璧有瑕，請指示王。”王授璧，相如因持璧卻立，倚柱，怒髮上衝冠，謂秦王曰：“大王欲得璧，使人發書至趙王，趙王悉召群臣議，皆曰：‘秦貪，負其彊，以空言求璧，償城恐不可得。’議不欲與秦璧。臣以為布衣不[不字點去]之交尚不相欺，况大國乎！臣以一璧之故逆彊秦之驩，不可。於是趙王乃齋戒五日，使臣奉璧，拜送書於庭。何者？嚴大國之威以修敬也。今臣至，大王見臣列觀，禮節甚倨；得璧，傳之美人以戲弄臣。臣觀大王無意償趙王城邑，故臣復取璧。大王必欲急臣，臣頭（今）與璧俱碎於柱矣。”相如持其璧睨柱，欲以擊柱。秦王恐其破璧，乃辭謝固請，召有司按圖，指從此以往十五都與趙。相如度秦王特以詐陽[詳]為與趙城，實不可得，乃謂秦王曰：“和氏璧，天下所共傳寶也，趙王恐，不敢不獻。趙王送璧時，齋戒五日，今大王亦宜齋戒五日，設九賓于廷，臣乃敢上璧。”秦王度之，终不敢[可]彊奪，遂許齋五日，舍相如廣成傳。（舍）相如度秦王雖齋，決負約不償城，乃使其從者衣褐，懷其璧，從徑道（亡），歸璧于趙。秦王齋五日後，乃設九賓禮於廷，引趙使者藺相如。相如至，謂秦王曰：“秦自繆公以來廿餘君，未嘗有堅明約束者也。臣誠恐見欺於王而負趙，故令人持璧歸，間至趙矣。且秦彊而趙弱，大王遣一介之使至趙，趙立奉璧來。今以秦之彊而先割十五都與趙，趙豈敢留璧而得罪於大王乎？臣知欺大王之罪當誅，臣請就湯镬，唯大王與群臣熟計議之。”秦王與群臣相視而嘻。左右或欲引相如去，秦王因曰：“今殺相如，終不能得璧也，而絕秦趙之驩，不如因而厚遇之，使歸趙，趙王豈以一壁之故欺秦邪！”卒廷見相如，畢禮而歸之。相如既歸，趙王以為賢大夫使不辱於諸侯，拜相如為上夫大[二字順序倒反]。（秦亦不以城予趙，趙亦终不予秦璧。）其後（……）與秦王會澠池。（……）（即罷歸國，以）相如功大，拜為上卿，位在廉頗之右。廉頗曰：“我（為趙將），有攻城野戰之大功，而藺相如徒以口舌為勞，（而）位居我上，（且相如素賤人，吾羞，不忍為之下。”宣言曰）：“我見相如，必辱之。”（相如聞，不肯與會。相如每朝時，常稱病，不欲與廉頗爭列。 已而）相如出，望見廉頗，（相如）引車避匿。（於是）舍人相與諫（曰：“臣所以去親戚而事君者，乃慕君之高義也。今君與廉頗同列，廉君宣惡言而君畏匿之，恐懼殊甚，且庸人尚羞之，况於將相乎！臣等不肖，）請辭（去）。（藺相如固止之，曰：“公之視廉將軍孰與秦王？”曰：“不 若也。”）相如曰：“（夫以秦王之威，而相如廷叱之，辱其群臣，）相如虽駑，獨 畏廉將軍哉？公之視廉將 軍孰與秦王？ 顧（吾念之，）彊秦（之所以）不敢加兵於趙者，徒以吾兩人在也。（今）两虎共鬥，其勢不俱生。吾所以為此者，（以）先 國家之急而後私讎也。”（廉頗聞之，肉袒負荆，因賓客至藺相如門謝罪。曰：“鄙賤之人， 不知將軍寬之至此也。”卒相與驩，為刎頸之交。）[2]

1. Wild Geese (12 columns in standard script)
The wild geese are flying;
Suk, suk go their wings.
The soldiers are on the march;
Painfully they struggle through the wilds.
In dire extremity are the strong men;
Sad are their wives, left all alone.

The wild geese are flying;
They have lighted in the middle of the marsh.
The soldiers are walling a fort;
The hundred cubits have all risen.
Though they struggle so painfully,
At last they are safely housed.

The wild geese are flying;
Dolefully they cry their discontent.
But these were wise men
Who urged us in our toil,
And those were foolish men
Who urged us to make mischief and rebel.

Wild Geese

鴻鴈，美宣王也。萬民離散，不安其居。而能勞來還，定安集之。至于矜寡，無不得其所焉。
鴻鴈于飛，肅肅其羽。之子于征，劬勞于野。爰及矜人，哀此鰥寡。
鴻鴈于飛，集于中澤。之子于垣，百堵皆作。雖則劬勞，其究安宅。

3. White Colt (10 columns in standard script)

Unsullied the white colt
Eating the young shoots of my stackyard.
Keep it tethered, keep it tied
All day long.
The man whom I love
Here makes holiday.

Unsullied the white colt
Eating the bean leaves of my stackyard.
Keep it tethered, keep it tied
All night long.
The man whom I love
Is here, a lucky guest.

Unsullied the white colt
That came so swiftly.
Like a duke, like a lord
Let your revels have no end.
Prolong your idle play,
Protract your leisure.

Unsullied the white colt
In that deserted valley,
With a bundle of fresh fodder.
'Though you, its master, are fair as jade
Do not let the news off you be rare as gold or jade,
Keeping your thoughts far away.’

White Colt

4. Yellow Bird (8 columns in standard script)

O oriole, yellow bird,
Do not settle on the corn,
Do not peck at my millet.
The people of this land
Are not minded to nurture me.
I must go back, go home
To my own land and kin.

O oriole, yellow bird,
Do not settle on the mulberries,
Do not peck my sorghum.
With the people of this land
One can make no covenant.
I must go back, go home
To where my brothers are.

O oriole, yellow bird
Do not settle on the oaks,
Do not peck my wine–millet.
With the people of this land
One can come to no understanding.
I must go back, go home
To where my own men are.

5. I Walk the Wilderness (8 columns in standard script)

I went into the country;
Deep the shade of the ailanto.
It was as bride and wife
That I came to your house.
But you did not provide for me––
Sent me back to land and home.

I went into the country;
I plucked the dockleaf.
It was as bride and wife
That I came to live with you.
But you did not provide for me––
Back to my home you sent me.

I went into the country;
I plucked the pokerweed.
You thought nothing of the old marriage––
Found for yourself a new mate.
Not for her wealth, oh no!
But merely for a change.

I Walk the Wilderness

我行其野，刺宣王也。
我行其野，蔽芾其樗。昏姻之故，言就爾居。爾不我畜，復我邦家 。
我行其野，言采其蓫。昏姻之故，言就爾宿。爾不我畜，言歸思復。

6. No Goats (12 columns in standard script)

Who says you have no sheep?
Three hundred is the flock.
Who says you have no cattle?
Ninety are the black–lips.
Here your rams come,
Their horns thronging;
Here your cattle come,
Their ears flapping.

Some go down the slope,
Some are drinking in the pool,
Some are sleeping, some waking.
Here your herdsmen come
In rush–cloak and bamboo–hat,
Some shouldering their dinners.
Only thirty brindled beasts!
Your sacrifices will not go short.

Your herdsman comes,
Bringing faggots, bringing brushwood,
With the cock–game, with hen–game.
Your rams come,
Sturdy and sound;
None that limps, none that ails.
He beckons to them with raised arm;
All go up into the stall.

Your herdsman dreams,
Dreams of locusts and fish,
Of banners and flags.
A wise man explains the dreams:
'Locusts and fishes
Mean fat years.
Flags and banners
Mean a teeming house and home.'

無羊，宣王考牧也。
誰謂爾無羊？三百維群。誰謂爾無牛？九十其犉。爾羊來思，其角濈濈。爾牛來思，其耳濕濕。
或降于阿，或飲于池，或寢或訛。爾牧來思，何蓑何笠。或負其餱，三十維物，爾牲則具。
爾牧來思，以薪以蒸，以雌以雄。爾羊來思，矜矜兢兢，不騫不崩。麾之以肱，畢來既升。
牧人乃夢，眾維魚矣，旐維旟矣。大人占之：眾維魚矣，實維豐年。旐維旟矣，室家溱溱。

In the tenth year of the Jiaqing reign era [1805] Yungu [Ye Menglong, 1775–1832] invited me to take this anonymous painting to see Minister of the Court of State Ceremonial, Weng Tanxi [Weng Fanggang, 1733–1818], who firmly identified it as Ma Yuan’s (active ca. 1190–1225) work. He also pointed out in detail its refinement and subtle depth. It has been eight years since then. Now viewing it, I am convinced. On the nineteenth of the third lunar month in the guiyou year [April 19, 1813] Yi Bingshou recorded this in the Youshi Zhai studio. [Seals]: Moqing, Wu dezhi zhongxin

This painting must have been a longer scroll but lost part of its beginning and end due to damages. Examining its brushwork, I found lines sometimes thinner than a hair but all executed with centered tip of a brush held from a suspended wrist, of which none but the Song masters were capable. Yungu bought it from a painting store at a low price. It has been identified as a work by Painter-in-attendance Ma [Yuan] because its style was close to that of the Academy and Ma was the best of the Academy’s painters. Xie Lansheng, Lifu, inscribed this in summer, the fifth lunar month, of the jiaxu year in the Jiaqing reign era [1814]. [Seal]: Xie Lansheng yin

In terms of brushwork, [this painting] is close to those by Yan Wengui (active ca. 970–1030) and Liu Songnian (active ca. 1175–after 1195). Ma Yuan’s brushwork has comparable vigor and antique flavor, but not its purity and expansiveness. Weng Zhengsan [Weng Fanggang] did detailed research on stone and bronze inscriptions, but seldom spent time probing the spirit and principle of calligraphy. On painting he was even farther from correct. I have seen many genuine works by Ma Yuan in my life, which bear no resemblance to this painting. Since it has no [artist’s] signature, I dare not name anyone as the painter. No one should complain, though, if I categorically attribute it to a Song master. This scroll has been remounted several times. A certain bad conservator peeled off its original backing paper, and the painting lost some of its luster as a result. It is regrettable. Luo Tianchi viewed this in the Haishan Xianguan Studio [of the Pan family in Guangzhou]. [Seal]: Luo shi Liuhu

4. Chen Rentao 陳仁濤 (active mid-20th c.), 37 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1953; 3 seals:

The long handscroll on silk to the right, which I entitled A Diplomatic Mission to the Jin, is a rare masterwork among northern paintings. In it is a courier pavilion-station with tall pines on its sides. To the right stand clustered mountains and valleys; to the left is a pass with a bridge. Beyond the pass and the bridge, fragmented views of mountains and waters flicker in and out of distant clouds and dark mist. In the pavilion the table is empty without wine utensils. To the south of the pavilion are three members of the Jin courier station. The one holding a lute seems bidding farewell to his guests before his return. To the left of the path stand two clerks with clasped hands expressing goodwill and gratitude. Alone on the stone steps to the west of the pavilion is a lowly menial in Han costume, reluctant to see the Chinese delegation leave. To the west of the stone steps are four Chinese emissaries. Looking low-spirited, they whisper among themselves on horseback rather than hit the road right away. Further west, a Jin soldier holds the reins and looks back, seeming to stir the horse with an utterance. Still to the west, a soldier with a courier’s letter on his back speeds the horse, seemingly on a mission to order the pass’s gatekeeper to allow the emissaries’ return. Spreading out this painting, one vividly senses the humiliation of the defeated Song regime and the arrogance of the Jin through the silent brush and ink. It used to be considered a Song work. Yi Bingshou and Weng Fanggang thought it was painted by Ma Yuan. Luo Tianchi thought it was close to Yan Wengui’s or Liu Songnian’s style. They were all wrong. Since the painting’s subject is the Jin, it shouldn’t have been painted by a Song artist. But there is deep, hidden meaning beyond the painted images that a Jurchen artist would not have tried either. In my opinion, after the court moved [to the south], a former Song subject who turned to serve the Jin may have painted it out of longing for the past nation, a sad man with conflicting emotions. Its style particularly reminds me of Yang Bangji. Bangji, whose zi is Demao, was a native of Huayin in Shaanxi. Under the Jin, he served as Vice Director of the Palace Library, Hanlin Academician, and Military Commissioner of Yongxingjun [present-day Xi’an region]. He painted landscapes, human figures, and horses well. His father, Tao, served as Assistant Administrator of Yizhou [present-day Yi Xian, Hebei] under the Song. At the fall of the city, he was killed by the Jin army. Bangji, a young child, hid in a Buddhist temple and escaped death. He was, therefore, a descendant of a loyalist, who served his enemies after the dynastic change. He was the so-called “official of a perished ruler or son of a concubine who worries with a sense of urgency and fears disasters with deep apprehension.”[2] It was only appropriate that he exhausted his mind and thought to paint this scroll to express obliquely his inner loyalty to his own country. Years ago I saw his landscape painting after the style of Li Cheng (919–967). In it old pines spread disarrayed branches and the human figures appear energetic and spirited, which seemed to be painted by the same artist as this scroll. So shouldn’t this scroll come from the hand of Vice Director of the Palace Library Yang as well? Chen Rentao wrote in the winter of the guisi year [1953].

On the first day of the second lunar month in the first year of the Zhida reign era [February 23, 1308], the day after Baizhu [1298–1323] was appointed to the rank of Palace Guard, in the West Lotus Leaf Hall on the hill in the garden of the Palace of Surpassing Happiness, [I], the official Wang Zhenpeng, was commanded by an imperial decree of Emperor Renzong [r. 1311–1320], [who at the time lived] in the residence of the heir apparent, to copy the draft of Vimalakirti and the Doctrine of Nonduality by Ma Yunqing of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234).[1]

至大元年二月初一日，拜住怯薛第二日，隆福宮花園山子上西荷葉殿內，臣王振鵬特奉仁宗皇帝潛邸聖旨，臨金馬雲卿畫 《維摩不二圖》 草本。

2. 25 columns in standard script, undated:

In the second lunar month of the wushen year of the Zhida reign era [February 23–March 22, 1308] Emperor Renzong, while at the Spring Palace [of the heir apparent], took out a painting on silk of Vimalakirti and the Doctrine of Nonduality by the former Jin [subject] Ma Yunqing so that I, the official Zhenpeng, could copy it on Dong silk and also explain the meaning of the phrase “nonduality.” Carefully following the Buddhist canon I accordingly stated:

In the city of Vaisali there was a layman whose Indian name was Vimalakirti, which is translated [in Chinese] as Jingming [“Pure Name”]. He was the reincarnation of the Golden Grain Tathagatha. He had a profound understanding of the Law. At home he manifested illness, and when visitors came to inquire about his condition, he preached the Law. Then Shakyamuni [tried to] send bodhisattvas to inquire about Vimalakirti’s illness, but many said that they had done so in the past and were incapable of responding [to his questions]. Therefore, they were unqualified to go. At last Manjushri said: “This gentleman is one to whom it is difficult to respond. He profoundly understands reality and excels in expounding the essence of the Law.” Thereupon Manjushri himself went. [When] the other bodhisattvas heard that Manjushri was going, they said [Vimalakirti and Manjushri] will certainly discuss the wondrous Law. So they all followed along.
When they arrived at Vimalakirti’s room, [they found that] due to his illness he sat alone in bed. Manjushri said, “The sage layman is ill, so Shakyamuni has sent me to inquire [about his condition].” After their conversation, Shariputra thought there were not any other seats in the room. Vimalakirti used his magical power, and instantly the Light King Tathagatha of Merudhvaja sent 32,000 lofty, vast, solemn, and pure lion-thrones to the room, where all were accommodated. The two great beings [Vimalakirti and Manjushri] sat down. Shariputra and Nara-ya Bodhisattva, because their thrones were so lofty and vast, could not ascend them. Vimalakirti ordered them to bow to the Light King Tathagatha of Merudhvaja, and afterward they were able to sit down.

Vimalakirti asked all of the bodhisattvas how one enters the Dharma gate of Nonduality. Each and every one of the bodhisattvas expressed his opinion. Manjushri addressed Vimalakirti, saying, “We have now spoken. Benevolent One, you should expound how one enters the Dharma gate of Nonduality.” Vimalakirti remained silent. Manjushri exclaimed, “Wonderful, wonderful! To remain silent is to have truly obtained the Law of Nonduality.” Then, Shariputra thought it was time to eat. Vimalakirti transformed himself into a bodhisattva and went to the Buddha of the Land of Fragrance to pick up a bowl of rice, and returned instantaneously. The fragrance of the rice permeated Vaisali City, and all the great beings attending the gathering became full upon inhaling the fragrance. There was a goddess in the room who was listening to the heavenly beings discussing the Law. She then appeared and scattered heavenly flowers. When they landed on the bodies of the bodhisattvas, the flowers fell off. When they landed on the body of one of Buddha’s great disciples (Shariputra), they did not. The disciple tried to get rid of the flowers with his magic power, but failed. The goddess asked why he did so. He replied: “These flowers do not compare to the Law; that is why I want to get rid of them.” The goddess said: “Do not say that the flowers do not match the Law. The flowers do not make any difference. It must be because you have not renounced your mundane desire that the flowers cling to your body. If you had renounced your mundane desire, the flowers would not cling to your body.” That is why the Tang monk Jiaoran (active ca. 766–804) has a poem: “The Chan maiden came to challenge. / Holding flowers, she intends to tarnish my robe. / Attentively, I gave back the flowers.” Su Dongpo [Su Shi, 1037–1101] has a poem “Guest Wearing Flowers”: “Mundane desires have dissipated gradually; / you cannot keep them. / On the contrary, return them to the flower-scattering goddess.” And “The place the lay devotee of Vaisali expounded ‘emptiness’ / Mundane desire has been extinguished and flowers need not be scattered. / Try to convince the goddess to use rouge and powder. / Even one thousand lively Buddhist hymns will not provoke a word.” And “Would that the reclining sick one respect Manjushri.” Another poem by Su Dongpo, “Requesting Leave Due to Sore Arms”:

“By a low window in a small pavilion, reclining on a mild and peaceful day / I remain in total silence. / Vimalakirti was not ill, but I truly am. / Who understands Dongpo’s gate of nonduality?” Dongpo also has a poem, “The Sculpture of Vimalakirti”: “When he was here, someone asked him about the Law. / He bowed his head and did not speak, knowing in his own mind.” Du Fu (712–770) inscribed a portrait of Vimalakirti by Gu Kaizhi (ca. 348–ca. 409): “The portrait of Golden Grain Tathagatha is marvelous and difficult to forget.” Dongpo inscribed a painting of Vimalakirti by Shike (fl. mid-10th c.): “I observe Shike, a recluse, wearing hemp shoes, / threadbare hat, and two elbows worn through. / He can depict Vimalakirti with the tip of his brush; / His magic power surpassed Vimalakirti.” I saw Ma Yunqing’s Vimalakirti and the Doctrine of Nonduality. His brushwork is of surpassing excellence. He seems to have perceived and entered the gate of nonduality. Hasn’t his magic power surpassed that of Vimalakirit? At that time, I was instructed to make a copy [of Ma Yunqing’s Vimalakirti and the Doctrine of Nonduality] and decorate it with color. After I had completed it, I summarized the story and presented it [to the throne]. Hence I obtained the draft and treasure it. In my spare time I unroll it to entertain myself. Respectfully inscribed by Wang Zhenpeng of Dongjia [modern Wenzhou, Zhejiang].[2]

至大戊申二月仁宗皇帝在春宮,出張子有平章所進故金馬雲卿繭紙畫 《維摩不二圖》，俾臣振鵬臨於東絹，更敘說不二之因。振鵬謹按： 《釋典》 有云：“毗耶離城中有居士梵名維摩詰，譯言淨名,乃金粟如來後身。入深法門，在室示病，徃問疾者，以疾而為說法。爾時世尊遣諸菩薩問疾，菩薩眾皆言，某甲昔各有因，謁問維摩詰，別無詶應，是以不任徃問。最後曼殊大士言，彼上人者難為詶對，深達實相，善說要法。於是曼徃殊乃自徃問,其菩薩眾聞曼殊徃，謂必談妙法，皆亦隨徃。及眾至,維摩詰丈室中以疾獨坐一床，曼殊言居士疾，世尊遣致問，時問答已。舎利弗念丈室別無床座，維摩詰以神通力，即時須彌，相國須彌燈王如來遣三萬二千獅子座高廣嚴淨來入室中，悉皆包容。二大士既坐，舎利弗及新發意，菩薩等以座高廣，皆不能登，維摩詰令舎利弗等為須稱燈王作禮畢，各得登座。維摩詰問菩薩眾云：‘何入不二法門？’諸菩薩眾各各以意說已，唯曼殊問維摩詰：‘我等今已說仁者，當說何等是入不二法門？’時維摩詰嘿然無語。曼殊歎曰：‘善哉！善哉！乃至無有語言，是真入不二法門。’又舍利弗心念食時已至，維摩詰現化菩薩往眾香國香積佛取飯一鉢即至，飯香薰滿毗耶離城，會眾聞香悉飽。又丈室中有一天女，聞諸天人說法，即現身以天花散諸菩薩身上，花皆墮落，至一大弟子身上，花不墮，弟子以神力去花，不能去。天女問：‘何故去花？’答曰：‘此花不如法，是以去之。’天女曰：‘勿謂此花不如法，是花無所分別，想爾結習未盡，花著身矣。結習已盡，花不著矣。’”故唐僧皎然詩云：“禪女來相試，將花欲染衣。禪心定不起，還捧舊花歸。”東坡有〈坐上戴花〉詩云：“結習漸消留不住，却須還與散花天。”又云：“毗耶居士談空處，結習已空花不墜。試教天女御鉛華，千偈翻瀾無一語。”又云：“要令臥疾致文殊。”又坡〈因臂痛謁告〉詩云：“小閣低窓臥晏溫，了然非嘿亦非言。維摩未病吾真病，誰識東坡不二門？”又坡有〈維摩塑像〉詩云：“當其在時或問法，俛首無言心自知。”杜工部〈題顧愷之畫維摩像〉云：“虎頭金粟影，神妙獨難忘。”又東坡〈題石恪畫維摩〉云：“我觀石子一處士，麻鞋破帽露兩肘。能使筆端出維摩，神通又過維摩詰。”振鵬詳觀馬雲卿所作 《維摩不二圖》，筆意超絕，似亦悟入不二門，豈非神通過於摩詰者乎?振鵬當時奉命臨摹，更為修飾潤色之。圖成，并述其概略，進呈，因得摹本珍藏，暇日展玩以自娛也。東嘉王振鵬拜手謹識。

揠苗鄙宋人，抱甕[慚蒙莊。
何如銜尾]鴉，倒流竭池塘。
䆉[稏舞]翠浪，蘧蒢[生]晝涼。
斜陽掛高柳，笑歌閑女郎。

收刈 (harvesting)
田家刈穫時，腰鐮競倉卒。
霜濃手龜坼，日永身罄折。
兒童行拾穗，風色[淩短]褐。
歡呼荷檐歸，望望屋山月。

登場 (stacking)
禾黍已登場，稍覺農事優。
黃雲滿高架，白水空西疇。
用此可卒嵗，願言免[防]秋。
太平本無象，村舍炊煙浮。

持穗 (threshing)
霜時天氣佳，風[勁]木葉脫。
持穗及此時，連枷聲亂發。
黃雞啄遺粒，烏鳥喜聒聒。
歸家抖塵埃，夜屋燒榾柮。

簸揚 (winnowing)
臨風細簸揚，糠粃零風前。
傾瀉雨聲碎，把玩玉粒圓。
短帬箕帚婦，收拾亦已[專]。
豈圖較斗升，未敢忘凶年。

礱 (hulling)
推挽人摩肩，碾轉石礪齒。
殷床作春雷，旋風落雲子。
有如布山川，培塿執相峙。
前時斗量珠，滿眼俄有此。

舂碓 (grinding)
娟娟月過墻，蔌蔌風吹葉。
田家當此時，村舂響相答。
行聞炊玉香，會見流匙滑。
更須水轉輪，地碓勞蹴蹋。

籭 (sifting)
茅檐閑杵臼，竹屋細籭簸。
照人[珠]璣[光]，奮臂風雨過。
計功初不淺，飽食良[自]賀。
西鄰華屋兒，醉飽正高臥。

入倉 (storing)
天寒牛在欄，嵗莫粟入庾。
田父有餘樂，曝背臥檐廡。
卻愁催租稅，胥吏來旁午。
輸官王事了，索飯兒叫怒。

Danian [Zhao Lingrang], as a young nobleman living in a peaceful time and amusing himself with brush and ink, showed a surprising grasp of the flavor of rivers and lakes. In this scroll the forests and trees are hoary and archaic, and people go about fishing and woodcutting unhurriedly. The flabby and vexatious life [of a young nobleman] is suddenly completely washed clean. When opening the scroll, we are fairly overwhelmed by the feelings stirred up by this hermitage by the sea. How such a scroll should be treasured.[2] Mengfu [Seal]: Zhao shi Zi’ang

Yu Hang 俞沆 (active early 19th c.), 8 columns in standard script, dated 1826:

Of the so-called Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Yunlin [Ni Zan] was the purest in character. His painting and calligraphy, therefore, exhibit an untrammeled subtlety that is unrivaled in the past or the future. This painting for Shengbo, accompanied with a poem, shows his artistry even better. At that time, Yunlin was friends with Zhang Boyu [Zhang Yu, 1283-1350], Ke Jingzhong [Ke Jiusi, 1290-1343] and Wang Shuming [Wang Meng, 1308-1385], but was particularly close to Yu Shengbo, the eighth-generation descendant of Duke Yong[guo] [Yu Yunwen, 1110-1174]. That was why he painted this scroll, which naturally differed from his other works. It was at first in Xiang Molin’s [Xiang Yuanbian, 1525-1590] collection; then it went to Gao Jiangcun [Gao Shiqi, 1645-1704], and was recorded in his Xiaoxia lu. Sometime later it entered Miao Wenzi’s [Miao Yuezao, 1682-1761] collection. Last year [Lü] Songhuo (active early 19th c.), while traveling in Suzhou, traded a certain Ming calligraphic piece for this scroll. He brought it back and showed me, asking for an inscription to record its history. In the sixth year of the Daoguang era [1826], during the last decade of the second month of the bingxu year, Zixian, Yu Hang, inscribed.[2]

元時四逸，惟雲林氣節最高潔，故書畫得逸中妙趣，過去未來無與其匹。此幅為勝伯作，兼系以詩，益見精妙。蓋當時雲林相契張伯雨、柯敬仲、王叔明，虞勝伯則雍公八世孫，而與勝伯尤密，故有是作，較他幅又自不同也。原藏項墨林，後歸高江邨，載入 《消夏錄》，不知何時而得繆文子收藏。去年松壑客吳門，以明人手澤易得之，携歸視余，并属題數言以記顛末。道光六年歲次丙戌仲春下澣子僊俞沆識。

(8 columns in standard script, dated 1339)

After I painted Enjoying the Wilderness in an Autumn Grove for Xiaoshan, he brought it back to me in the mid ninth month for an inscription. It happened that on the fifteenth of last month, upon seeing the blossoming cassia tree in front of my Jingchu Zhai Studio, I composed the following poem. From spring to autumn this year there hadn’t been a single day when I felt truly inspired. That was the only thing I composed, which I recorded at the left:

How I delight in autumn, both the inkstone and mat cool;
With the bamboo shade rolled up, a fine dew on my robe.
Forest gate and cave mouth bring forth fresh pleasures;
Green rain and yellow mist enclose my remote bed.
In the bright days, bamboo wave in the breeze;
In the dark nights, parasols of fir hold up the moon.
Burning incense I use [a censor in the form of] a gilded duck;
Gathering scattered petals I place them inside my pillow.
On the fourteenth day of the ninth lunar month of the jimao year [October 16, 1339], Yunlinsheng, Ni Zan.

余既與小山作 《秋林野興圖》，九月中小山携以索題。適八月望日，經鉏齋前木犀盛開，因賦下章。今年自春徂秋，無一日有好興味，僅賦此一長句于左方：
政喜秋山研席涼，卷簾微露淨衣裳。
林扉洞戶發新興，翠雨黃雲籠遠牀。
竹粉因風晴靡靡，杉幢承月夜蒼蒼。
焚香底用添金鴨，落蘂仍宜副枕囊。
已卯秋九月十四日雲林生倪瓚

(5 columns in standard script, dated 1354):
In the winter [of the fourteenth year of the Zhizheng era], the eleventh month of the jiawu year [1354], I stopped on my travel at the South Bank of Fuli [a town near Suzhou]. Lu Mengde, who just returned from Wusung [near Shanghai], brought this to show me. It has been kept in the family of his friend, Mr. Huang Yunzhong. I painted this on a whim. It has been sixteen years since then. I sighed at the sight of it, which felt like from another world. Zan, having inscribed it a second time at the left [of the picture], gave it back. On the nineteenth day [December 3, 1354].

[至正十四]年歲在甲午冬十一月，余旅泊甫里南渚。陸孟德自吳松歸，携以相示，蓋藏於其友人黃君允中家。余一時戲寫此圖，距今十有六年矣，對之悵然，如隔世也，瓚重題其左而還。十九日。

The prince of the Dao was gifted and wise by nature. In the art of painting he attained the ultimate in subtlety. With an ability almost beyond anything human, he could depict the essential character of plants and animals so that they were as though created by nature. In this scroll he has not labored much with ink and colors, yet all is spontaneous and right. It is proper that generations have treasured it. What good fortune for these insignificant birds to have been painted by this sage. Mengfu wrote this colophon with respect.[1]

When I was an official in Shexian [in Anhui Province] I had already considered retiring. At that time, Cishan (Li Jie) held a position in Xiuning [in Anhui Province] and I heard from him quite often. Ten years later, I retired from the position of Secretarial Court Gentleman, returned home, and built a house by the Stone Lake [near Suzhou]. Cishan, who was then prefect of Kunshan [in Suzhou Prefecture], envied me so much that he also began thinking of preparing a retreat for himself on the Tiao and Zha Rivers [in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province]. Twenty years later, [Li Jie] finally brought this Fisherman’s Lodge scroll to show me. I have suffered from illness and exhaustion for so long that only during the last four or five years have I been able to spend my time enjoying the lake. Though I had beautiful surroundings, I could not really have my reclusion as Tao Yuanming (Tao Qian, 365–427) did. Although Cishan got his ""Fisherman’s Lodge"" later than I, he is healthy and is able to accompany his parents and enjoy the beautiful scenery. With parents to be attended and with a lot of children around--this makes for the happiest life. I am ten thousand times more envious of him than he once was of me. I hope my illness can be cured quickly. When the peach trees are in bloom and the streams are full, I’d like to sail to Xisai in a skiff. After asking the host to purchase fish and wine, we’ll set sail, chanting to the tune of Songxi and inviting fishing boys and young wood-gatherers to sing along. Having enjoyed ourselves to the full, we’ll return to the Wusong River and Lake Tai in a fresh breeze. With emerald waters reaching to the sky and raindrops knocking on the thatched awning, it will be a perfect time for an inebriated nap. If I can fulfill this dream, it will be something extraordinary. So I write this at the end of this handscroll, anticipating the real journey.

2. Hong Mai 洪邁 (1123–1202), 17 columns in standard script, dated November 13, 1188:

When my late father returned from the court, he brought with him one fisherman hanging scroll by the Master of Original Truth (Zhang Zhihe), an item from Huizong’s collection. The painting bore Huizong’s cipher. It was kept and hung on a plain wall, and even people with little understanding of painting would know how unsurpassingly it captured the spirit (of its subject). Executed in colors, the painting showed small mountain paths in a remote fastness. Whether one wears a rough linen scarf and work clothes and (holds) a fishing pole in a thatched-covered boat, or whether one wanders to and fro among water plants in the wind and dew. One forgets the world and it is as if one has planted one’s feet amid the vermillion towers and ethereal palaces of the immortals. If I try to imagine where such a place could be, it seems almost like a portrait of Xisai Mountain. Oh what lofty soaring! The world of mortals does not have this scenery, but Li Cishan from Heyang one day actually acquired it. If I can’t wander with the Master of Original Truth, then I can wander with Cishan and that is enough. If I can’t reach Xisai Mountain, then seeing this Fishing Society painting is enough! Cishan served three times in positions that paid two thousand piculs of rice (the emolument of a Prefect), and yet he has remained poor and an impoverished scholar; one can not have the two (i.e., wealth and enjoying eremitism) both in a big way. Yet how could “peach blossoms and flowing water” (an allusion to one of the “Fisherman Songs” of Zhang Zhihe and the utopia in Tao Yuanming’s “Peach Blossom Spring”), which are heaven given, place a limit on his enjoyment? Xisai is situated in Wuxing, hence the Master of Original Truth has the line about the old fisherman angling in a bend of the Zha River. Huangzhou also has a mountain (by the same name), the very one where Prince Cao Cheng of the Tang deployed his soldiers. And Su Dongpo made a pair of songs to the tune of “An Island of Scattered Flowers”…… (quotation of Su’s lines that allude to Zhang Zhihe’s first “Fisherman Song”); and it is definitely about Wuxing. Hong Jinglu wrote this on the 23rd of the 10th month in the 15th year of the Chunxi Era (November 13, 1188).

先公從朝廷還，得元真子所作《清江漁釣》一軸，宣和故物也。天筆題識其上，由存挂之素壁，正不識畫者，知其為超妙入神，視丹青蹊徑漠然相絕。雖釣竿蓬艇，葛巾野服，常羊於菰莆風露閒，使人之意也消。若著腳於絳闕清都之上，翫其位置，直與西塞，溪山寫真，缥缥陵雲，人間世無此境也。而河南李次山一旦實得之，不得從元真子游，得從次山游足矣。不得至西塞山，得見此《漁社圖》足矣。次山三為二千石，而苦貧如窶士，物莫能兩大，豈桃花流水，天固有以嗇其享邪。西塞在吳興，故元真有“霅溪灣裏釣魚翁”之句，而黃州亦有之，乃唐曹成王用師處。東坡公嘗以偶散花洲被諸樂府，姑借為齊安重至於雲天篛笠江海簑衣之章，則固表其下，曰吳興矣。淳熙戊申十月廿三日野處洪景盧書。

3. Zhou Bida 周必大 (1126–1204), 22 columns in standard script, dated April 9, 1190:

During the Tang Dynasty, Yuan Jie, zi Cishan, once made his home on the Fan River [in Hubei Province]. With many fishermen as neighbors, he too carried a fishing net and sang songs to entertain himself; he thus called himself “The Unruly Old Man.” My contemporary Mr. Li, from Heyang, who takes his first name “Jie” from Yuan Jie and his zi Cishan from that of Yuan, has built an estate on the River Zha. He even gave himself the style name of “Fishing Society”, showing that he excels in taking Yuan for his model. First in the Qiandao era (1165-73), when I was in office at the capital, Mr. Li, in accord with the tradition of friendship of our forebears, brought this painting to me several times and requested me to write a colophon. I found myself fully preoccupied with the routine office work (literally: “wandering in the Donghua dust”); therefore, it was extremely hard for me even if I wanted to put down anything on the eremitic life under the Xisai Mountain and stream. Recently I accepted the order to retire and returned to Luling [in Jiangxi Province]. In the eastern corner of the city, not fifty paces away from the river, White Egret Island stretches. Daily, in a light skiff, I linger among the reeds. Sea gulls come and follow me; hundreds alight but do not settle for long. Although I don’t dare to compare myself with Zhang Zhihe privately, Yuan Cishan (Yuan Jie) and I are almost alike. But now, as an Imperial Secretary, you have been dispatched to administer the whole of Sichuan; the clerks and officials for the sixty-one prefectures and several hundred thousand soldiers and generals—all are under your jurisdiction and follow your orders. Yet you are still concerned with your old estate (“Fishing Society”); from then thousand li away, you send me a letter, together with this painting to urge me to carry out my former promise to write a colophon. Now even though I may desire to enumerate hurriedly the pleasures of reclusion, but your authorities and responsibilities are such that how can this be the time to encourage you to lead the life of a hermit? I will wait until that day when you retire to the sweet springs [allusions to Han imperial places of retirement or retreat], and then convey this message to me. At that time I will reply, for now I am unable to. For the time being, I write this colophon to return with your painting. Zhou Bida, the wild scholar of Qingyuan, wrote this on the 3rd day of the 3rd month in the 1st year of the Shaoxi reign (April 9, 1190).

唐元結字次山，嘗家樊上，與眾漁者為鄰，帶苓箵而歌款，乃自號聱叟。今河陽李君，名元名也，字元字也，卜築霅溪，又號漁社，其善學柳下惠者耶。始乾道間，予官中都，君以先世之契，數携此圖求跋。自念身游東華塵土中，欲為西塞溪山下語難矣。屬者奉祠歸廬陵，所居在城東隅，去江無五十步。洲名白鷺，橫陳其前。日以扁舟寅緣葦間，漚來相從，百住而不止。雖未敢竊比張志和，亦庶幾乎元次山矣。而君方以尚書郎奉使全蜀，凡六十一郡之官吏，數十萬之將士，莫不歛板受約束，銜枚聽號令。猶念舊社不置，萬里遣書與圖偕來，督踐前约。予欲遽數忘機之樂，則君權任如此，顧豈招隱時邪。須君它日奉計甘泉，厭直承明，尚寄聲于我，當有以告君，今未可也，姑題巻軸歸之。紹熙元年三月三日適逢丁巳。青原野夫周必大

4. Wang Lin 王藺 (1128–1192), 39 columns in standard script, dated June 9, 1191:

More than ten years ago, I was appointed to make a censorial tour. I heard that Pi Ling’s Prefect, Li Cishan was adroit in administrative skills, as well as disciplined and upright. I regretted that I did not have the chance to make his acquaintance. Then suddenly he was reported to the Tribunal of Censors, who criticized and cashiered him. I questioned it from the beginning. Whenever people came from Pi Ling, I questioned it from the beginning. Whenever people came from Pi Ling, I would inquire about it. They would say things that were no different from what I had heard before. Finally, an old friend, whose home was in a village outside Pi Ling and whom I could trust, happened to be transferred and came to see me. As soon as we sat down, I asked him about what I had been wondering. My friend said, “Although I reside in that area, I’ve had no real contact with him; however, public opinion can’t be suppressed.” My friend also said, “What’s more, on the day of Li Cishan’s dismissal, the whole prefecture – even all the clerks and errand boys – acclaimed his rectitude as something that had not been encountered before.” All my doubts were quickly dispelled. [From then on], among friends and colleagues, I often mentioned his having been wronged. Two or three years afterward, needing to support his family, Li Cishan went to serve at court. At the time I was also in attendance. Meeting him, I knew that he was an open and honest man, even surpassing that which I had heard. [Eventually] he received an appointment in Qichun [in Hubei Province], and so again came to call me. I said to Cishan, “Not many years ago I traveled along the Zha River. Two or three of the region’s honorable gentlemen invited me to tour the sacred sites and all the mountains. Gazing on Xisai Mountain, they pointed out places where white egrets were flying and said that this was, indeed, the old haunt of the Master of Original Truth (Zhang Zhihe). Our small boat moved smoothly along and we lifted our wine cups to toast one another. I loved the place for its serenity and seclusion; and could not help but imagine Zhang Zhihe. [At this time] I thought how could anyone possibly obtain a place to live on this mountain, not knowing that it had become Cishan’s property. One day when I return home by boat, I will make a detour and stop below Xisai Mountain, asking to see Cishan. Then I will satisfy your request; now I do not have the time (to write a colophon).” Thereupon, Cishan rolled up the painting and left. After that occasion, Cishan and I traveled to different places and so we did not meet up with one another for seven or eight years. This spring I relinquished my post and returned to my native village in the Huai River Valley; and Cishan left his position in Sichuan as Overseer-General. Granted the title of temple custodian [to retire], Cishan has come east. While on the river, he hasn’t minded going far out of his way to visit me. I have now shut my gate to the world; but since Cishan has come, we talk of old times and suddenly my feeble spirits revive. Cishan once again took out this painting, along with the colophons by others, and wanted me to fulfill my former promise. Although I have not been able to return to Xisai Mountain, I can not refuse. Since we last met, I had been at court for nearly ten years; still worried [with the state affair], I retired and returned home. My house is ramshackle and it does not keep out the wind and the rain. Spending all my savings from my service in the court, I could build only a simple dwelling and cultivate a garden of several acres, planting flowers and bamboo. Each day I walk with a staff, drinking and chanting poems with my brothers. Happening to tell Cishan the story of my house, he looked about at my rustic abode and couldn’t help but laugh; by his side, I laughed too. Cishan still hadn’t seen my forlorn and unkempt garden, otherwise one fit of laughter would not nearly have been enough! Because I knew Cishan was poor, I did not think his “Fishing Society” would be too grand. Since I inquired about its layout, Cishan replied, “Now that I have retired I will have pines cut and thatch woven, to build, appropriately, a house of several tens rafters across; and be the master of rivers and mountains, amusing myself in my declining years. If I want to live there only when it were majestic, then I will never be able to because I will be as poor as before; I would have to wait until the Yellow River clears.” Then I [Wang Lin] clapped my hands and laughed, saying, “Then your painting of the “Fishing Society” is merely a painting of a cake (to satisfy hunger; empty solace), how can you laugh at my rusticity! Cishan again laughed, retorting, “This you can write down!” And so, I include it here in my account for him. Wang Lin, layman of Xuanshan, wrote this on the 16th day of the fifth month in the 2nd year of the Shaoxi reign (June 9, 1191).

余十數年前備官周行，聞毗陵守李次山政術敏健，而持身甚廉，以不得識面為恨。忽報臺評罷去，昉疑焉。有來自毗陵者必詢之，其說不異於前。最後一故人，家毗陵之外邑，誠篤可信，適調官來謁，坐定首扣所疑。故人曰：“某雖居是邦，與之情分絕疏。然公論不可掩。”且言其罷去之日，闔郡之人下至胥史走卒，皆稱嘆其廉，以為前未之見。余疑頓釋，屢為稱屈於儕輩間。後二、三年次山以親養之迫造朝，余時在從班，一見知其為磊落人，又過於所聞矣。剖符蘄春復來訪，別袖出此圖相示，欲丐數語。余披圖驚喜，謂次山曰：“頃年過霅上，霅之二三子邀余游道場諸山。望西塞，指似白鷺飛處曰‘此即元真子之故棲。’小舟夷猶，舉酒相屬，愛其清絕，而想見其人，安得有此山而居之，不知乃今為次山物也。它時得歸浮家迂路，繫西塞下，求見次山，當承雅命。今則未有暇。”次山即持圖去。自是出處參差，不相值者復七、八年。今春余罷政還淮鄉，而次山自四蜀總計，奉祠東下，舟過江上，不遠數十里肯來訪余。余方杜門掃軌，得次山來，相對話舊，衰病頓醒。次山復出圖與諸公題跋，求踐前约。余雖未得重為西塞游，然不可辭也。余中間立朝近十年，以憂去國，來歸故廬。上漏下濕，不庇風雨，竭使北之橐，僅成此屋。旁闢數畝園，粗有卉竹，杖屨觴詠，日與兄弟同之。偶與次山話其故，次山顧視棟宇朴陋，不覺發笑。余亦從旁自笑。次山猶未見荒蕪之園，當不一笑而足。然余知次山清貧，漁社新築，想必不能宏壯，因詢其規橅，則曰：“此行息肩，將伐松誅茅，隨宜創數十椽，管領溪山，以娛暮景。若必宏壯而後居，則貧不異昔，猝未可辨，是俟河之清也。”余因撫掌大笑曰：“然則漁社之圖特畫餅爾，又何暇笑余之朴陋哉。”次山亦復大笑曰：“此可書也。”乃並書以與之。紹煕二年五月既望軒山居士王藺

5. Zhao Xiong 趙雄 (1129–1193), 33 columns in standard script, dated December 21, 1190:

I first became acquainted with Cishan in Suzhou, and I learned that he was talented, bright and capable. Wherever he was appointed, the area would be administered well, and among his contemporaries, he was renowned as a capable official. Some say this is shown especially in his employment of others. They also say although Cishan’s official career has been eminent, his desire for officialdom has been slight. His views are broad-minded and his élan is lofty and pure; he has the air of a high-minded scholar. At that time, I could only agree with their comment (for I did not have the opportunity of further knowing him). When Guangzong (r. 1189-1194) acceded to the throne, he commanded Cishan to assume the post of Imperial Secretary, and dispatched him to Sichuan as Overseer-General. At that time I had just received the post of Tongchuan’s Prefect. In the accounting office of Tongchuan’s salt management…there were many problems and the monthly quota could not be raised; the villages throughout the prefecture all had this failing. Cishan thereupon eliminated the excessive taxation and extended the deadline for receipt of payment. Tongchuan once again became a contented region. This time even more fully I realized Cishan’s talent. Shortly after that, I requested permission to retire with the title of temple custodian and returned home; and began to expand my estate south of River Nei, supervising my attendants in the planting of pines and chrysanthemums. From my dwelling, the river is about a mile away, so I also wanted to cultivate a small garden, designed for my later years. However, the scale of my estate is confined and its scenery is not remarkale in any way; and so I fear that it can not compare with Tao Yuanming’s garden of three paths, let alone with those of larger size. Not long after, Cishan sent me a letter, saying, “One lone official; ten thousand li away from home – how can this be normal? I submitted a memorial to the emperor (to ask to retire) and His Benevolence had it reported to me that I could. Now I am moving my tally to the right of the lake [Tai Hu] and will soon leave the three Gorges; I dared to paint it and present it to you, imploring that you write a word or two for me.” I unrolled the painting to look at it. Xisai Mountian and the Zha River are perhaps the most splendid spots in Wu Xing. The “Fishing Society” is located where they meet. The landscape is glorious and the flowers and trees are exceedingly beautiful; and [the scenic spot] extend for over ten li and everything is within the viewing distance of your villa – how marvelous this is! When I think back on my own estate, now even more than before I feel how laughably rustic it is. Therefore how I admire Cishan’s spirit and élan; it is truly as people have said in the past. But Cishan was just well known for this talent and capacity. Recently the emperor (Guangzong), in carrying on the throne, has just recognized and promoted him. How can (an able man like) Cishan finally recluded to his “Fishing Society”? Although I have never had the pleasure of visiting his residence there, I can view it in this painting. At the painting’s end, there are also colophons by Zhou Bida and Fan Chengda which record their impressions in detail. These two gentlemen I greatly admire, and yet I dare to follow their words with mine. Zhao Xiong, Wenshu, wrote this on the winter solstice in the 1st year (1190) of the Shaoxi Era (December 21, 1190).

始予識次山於吳中，知其才術敏彊，所至辨治，號一時能吏。或曰“此特見於用者耳。”次山官業雖隆，宦情寔薄，其胸次恢廓，韻度清遠，有高人囗士之風，予姑唯唯否否。

紹興嗣之詔，以次山為尚書郎，出總蜀計。予適叨守潼川，潼川鹽策之囗囗計府至多，月課不登，郡邑俱病。次山則蠲其苛取，而舒其期會，潼川於是復為樂國，予益知次山之能。居無何，予以請祠得歸。方増治衡宇於內江之陰。囗領僮奴，囗松種菊。自所居達江上可里所，亦欲葺成小圃，為終焉之計。然規橅狹隘，景物寒儉，猶恐不及囗彭澤之三徑，況大焉者乎。俄而次山囗來言曰：“萬里孤官，豈人之情。有詞籲天蒙恩報可，今移節湖右，出峽有日，將歸老於西塞山下矣。舊則山趾卜築，名曰漁社。敢圖此，獻其丐我一言。”予披圖閱之。西塞霅溪蓋吳興勝絕處，漁社寔據其會，山水明秀，花木奇麗，延袤十數里，皆為几席間物，猗歟盛哉。退視予之所營，益蕪陋可笑。因嘆次山胸次韻度，誠如曩時或人之言云。然次山方以才術聞，今天子纘祚，首加識擢，豈終隱於漁社者耶。予雖未登漁社堂，然得閱其圖，圖末又有周益公、范吳公大書，記述頗詳。二公予平生所敬信，敢嗣書其後。紹熙庚戌日南至資中趙雄溫叔書。

While I was serving at court, Li Cishan was the Prefect of Pi Ling. From our correspondence, I recognized that his talent was uncommon as could sense that his temperament was carefree. (At that time) I regretted not knowing him personally. This was sixteen years ago. It is not until now that Cishan is returning to Wuxing, after serving as the Overseer-General in Sichuan; and since I am leaving Qingzhou to go back to Sichuan, we have the chance to meet. Great is our admiration for one another, as if we had been old friends for a lifetime. Taking out this painting to show me, Cishan has asked me to write in seven large characters “Xisai Fishing Society” and “Xisai Mountain.” Under the circumstance that the boat is rocking back and forth, I must try to write it with much effort. As for Cishan’s pursuit of the lifestyle of Zhang Zhihe and his admiration of Yuan Jie, this has been discussed in length in the wonderful writing of the august gentlemen who preceded me; since they’ve fully expressed it; I will not repeat here. Because the mountains obstruct and the rivers and lakes are vast, I do not know when we might be able to see each other again. However, each time Cishan takes out and examines this scroll, may it be as if we meet to wander in the wonderful scenery of the Tiao and Zha Rivers. Yan Cangshu of Taiyuan wrote this on the 25th day of the 1st month in the 2nd year of the Shaoxi Era (February 20, 1191).

始予在朝行，李公次山守毗陵，書疏往來，知其才氣不羣，風流可想，恨未識之。距今十有六年。次山自總領蜀計歸吳，予自荊州還蜀，始識面。相與傾倒，如平生歡，出此圖相示，索西塞漁社及西塞山七大字。舟中搖兀，勉彊書之。若夫次山所以追迹釣徒，景慕聱叟者，則前鉅公偉人瑰詞傑筆固已盡之，茲不復贅。顧關山脩岨，江湖渺茫，未知見日。時展斯巻，如接勝游於苕霅之上云。紹熙二年正月廿五日太原閻蒼舒書。 [印]：閻蒼舒印章、晉原開國、寳守堂記

7. You Mao 尤袤 (1124–1193), 16 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1191:

The master of the “Fishing Society”, as an Imperial Secretary, was dispatched ten thousand li to Shu. There he served honorably, not compromising himself in the least. Now he is returning but among his possessions are only one or two Chaotian rocks. Certainly he has fulfilled the imperial expectation by his service. Taking out the painting of the “Fishing Society”, along with the three venerable colophons by Zhao Xiong, Zhou Bida, and Fan Chengda, Mr. Li wants me to add my name among theirs. From ancient times, lakes and mountains, the wind and the moon, only fishermen and woodcutters daily know these but can not enjoy them; whereas poets and scholars love these but can not possess them. Now, however, my esteemed friend has returned to retire among the forests and valleys. Moreover, he has acquired the former dwelling place of the Master of Original Truth (Zhang Zhihe); of his joy, how could he express it? Since even I am so deeply interested in it (eremitism), please inquire of the white egrets flying about the mountains for me how the Master of Original Truth has been nowadays. I was born in the year jiachen (1124), the same year as you, but my health has declined sharply. Now I beg to retire but haven’t yet received permission. In seeing you before your return to Zhejiang and unrolling this picture, in a trance, I too have the yearning to live like a hermit. Someday, I too will return home to tend my old garden, gaze upon Xisai Mountain. With a reed as my skiff, I would row my boat to call on you, noble friend, amid the cloud and water. Thumping on the gunnels and singing the line “Wearing a hat of bamboo leaves and cape of green rushes,” we’ll talk of past events and joke around to our hearts’ content — this would be unsurpassable. You Mao of Xishan wrote this at the middle of late spring (the 3rd month) in the 2nd year of the Shaoxi Era (1191).

漁社主人以尚書郎萬里使蜀，洗手奉法，一毫不以自污。歸裝枵然，止朝天石一二塊，真不負朝家委任之意。出示《漁社圖》及趙、周、范三老跋語，欲余附名其間。夫自古湖山風月，漁人樵子，有而不能享。詩人詞士，愛而不能有。今公袖功名之手，歸休林壑，又得元真子之故居，其樂何可勝道。老子於此興復不淺，為我問訊。山前白鷺，未知元真子，何如今日爾。予生甲辰與公同歲，而衰病特甚，方丐祠未得，請見公還浙，復披此圖，茫然起冥鴻之慕。行當歸耕故園，望西塞山，一葦可航。拏舟訪公雲水間，扣舷歌“青篛綠簑”之句，道舊故而笑樂亦一快也，因書軸尾。東坡所謂異日不為山中生客云。紹熙辛亥暮春中澣錫山尤袤書。

8. Ye 埜 (unidentified, active 2nd half 13th c.), 18 columns in standard script, dated 1275:

山人家住萬山裏，十八面峰鸞鳳峙。
自從束髮讀坡詞，人閒知有元真子。
西塞山邊白鷺飛，西塞山從何處起。
桃花流水鳜魚肥，桃花何處隨流水。
寤寐此景不可見，掩卷三嘆而已矣。
我今往來苕霅閒，維舟幾度上衡山。
客愛青山山愛客，白鷺飛去又飛還。
不知西塞在此境，望雲惆悵空盤桓。
自從今日見此圖，酒邊不覺為破顏。
恍如舟遇桃源僊，翻疑身在八節灘。
名公題跋語言妙，雲煙滿紙輝林巒。
漁社主人何處去？空留遺跡與人看。
漁社子，在何許？君昔慕張今慕汝。
猿驚鶴怨蕙帳空，滿地白雲誰是主？
山川如昼人物非，此度經過須記取。
只呼白鷺作主人，白鷺飛來無一語。
山青水綠思悠悠，船頭一霎斜風雨。

西塞漁社歌題王晉卿畫
煙螺幾疊青模糊，江澄如鏡芙蓉鋪。
漁舟盪漾葦間出，叩舷彷彿歌烏烏。
編茆結網自成社，百壺夜向沙頭沽。
何人世外有此樂，綠簑青笠神仙徒。
晉卿王孫生富貴，紫裘騘馬天街趨。
平生雅擅山水癖，不知斯境身親無。
邈然含豪寄遐想，白雲浩蕩江鷗俱。
得毋均州既放後，濯纓欲賦滄浪乎。
流傳百禩宛無恙，妙蹟豈有神明扶。
主人愛此若拱璧，赫蹏牢裏將軍廚。
晴牎偶爾出卷示，花香嵐翠粘輕襦。
壺冰一片朗相映，何必漁釣耽清娛。

又得八截句。
手挽江流洗俗塵，釣竿相伴號元真。
泥塗軒冕渾忘卻，自是嚴陵後一人。

鱖魚跳浪鷺絲飛，閒擁煙簑卧釣磯。
如此溪山家合住，斜風細雨更何歸。

刺史開筵禮法疎，山人高唱傲菰蘆。
千秋絕調誰能繼？賸有風流入畫圖。

綺裘公子畫通靈，山水因緣契杳冥。
為問錦堂高宴處，雲鬟可得及樵青。

西塞山頭別有天，浩歌獨往志和船。
落華流水非人境，莫辨黃州與霅川。

石湖題後益公題，逸品人爭鑒賞之。
若使當時坡老見，定書水調墨淋漓。

宣和名畫知多少？揔把煙雲付劫灰。
瀟灑獨留此卷在，只應看作鏡花來。

丹青品鑒古難真，吮墨濡豪[毫]看幾廵。
妙處但參空色外，瓊英燕石不須論。

王晉卿係宋駙馬，生長豪貴，而能與蘇子瞻、黃魯直、米元章諸公遊，宜其畫筆之高擅聲于宣、政朝也。卷寫西塞山漁社，按西塞山凡兩處，一在金陵，劉夢得〈西塞山懷古〉所云“王濬樓舩下益州，金陵王氣黯然收”是也。一在吳興，張志和〈漁歌〉所云“西塞山邊白鷺飛，桃花流水鱖魚肥”是也。此卷山川平遠，漁家翁媼童稚與夫罾網汕罩鳴榔之類騈集，光景在苕溪、霅溪間，其為吳興西塞山無疑矣。畫後歸李氏次山，次山致政歸老，往還苕霅，與畫中風物相宜。題詠者為周益公、范石湖、尤延之諸公。諸公望尊學富，不妄許人，而傾倒次山如許，則次山之為人從可知矣。晉卿畫本流傳漸稀，有終身不得見者。前奉敕題《僲山樓閣》，今於寧王府中復題《漁社》一圖，徵名藉前人以存于晉卿，有夙世緣也。乾隆十七年歲次壬申二月朔後五日長洲沈德潛謹題。昆明湛福謹書。 [印]：湛福私印、介庵、十年書、會心處、聊以自娛、筆禪、一簾花雨飛香、硯田農

1. Qing emperor Qianlong清帝乾隆 (1711–1799, r. 1736–1795), 19 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1747; 3 seals:

Of the Tang dynasty painters, the General [Cao Ba, 8th c.] excels in painting horses.
Among his students, only Han Gan learned the essence of his art.
The important thing in painting horses is to convey their spirit.
This gives them a life-like appearance.
A master hand likes to depict celestial horses;
To paint a lame one would be wasting ink.
[Cao] Ba once painted Night-shining White;
There is no doubt [Han] Gan also painted him.
We can see how [Han Gan] learned from his tutor.
The poet Du [Fu, 712–770] was not critical when he commented on Han's works.
What a pity! Du Fu's comments were not all preserved;
Only fragments remain and invite further study.
Han Gan did not care to follow old styles;
Established rules are not always everlasting.
Night-shining White really is Night-Shining White.
It resembles pear blossoms in a moon-lit court-yard.
[Emperor Xuanzong, r. 712–756] rode this horse in polo games,
And to banquets in his palace at the foot of Mt. Li.
All's gone! The joyous moments of the past
Are now like empty dreams.
Unrolling the scroll, I see the lofty spirit of the horse.
By tilting its head, the horse is recalling previous battles.
Though muzzled, the horse refuses to be saddled.
The painter's intention is at once obvious and concealed.
Each time I look at a good horse,
I am thinking of an eclectic Daoist doctrine.

Imperially inscribed in the early third lunar month of the dingmao year in the Qianlong reign era (1747). [Seals]: Shu fang run, Qianlong chenhan, Xiebi liu yun zao

唐家畫馬稱將軍，弟子入室惟韓幹。

權奇想見自師承，杜老畫肉非相訕。
惜乎轉語未留世，空擬金丹待久煉。
擇師已不屑陳閎，天閑矩矱多無萬。
照夜白真照夜白，却似梨花開月殿。
溫泉曾奉擊毬場，驪山每侍臨光宴。
當時歡樂已蕭條，炯戒詎惟標夢幻。
披圖矯矯見龍性，昂首似憶靈武戰。

2. Qing emperor Qianlong清帝乾隆 (r. 1736–1795), 8 columns in small semi-cursive script, dated 1746; 2 seals:

Han Gan is well-known in history for his horse paintings. The flesh and bone structure of his horses are painted truthfully with a free hand. I have read Zhang Yanyuan's Record of Famous Painters [of Successive Dynasties, preface dated 847], which says that Han was serving in the Tang court of Emperor Minghuang [i.e., Xuanzong, r. 712–56] and that Han painted such famous horses as ""Jade Flower"" and ""Night-shining White."" I have longed to see these originals. But I don't even know the whereabouts of them. Recently, there are people trying to sell Huang Gongwang's (1269–1354) Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains and other paintings. The work attributed to Huang is a fake. But this handscroll of ""Night-shining White"" by Han is so lively and powerful that it makes one feel he is looking at a real horse. There is no doubt about its authenticity. So I commanded that it be acquired and I am happy to fulfill one of my wishes. This is indeed a unique event. Imperially inscribed three days before the full-moon of the middle winter month of the bingyin year in the Qianlong reign era (December 23, 1746). [Seals]: Qian, Long

韓幹以畫馬擅名千古，其毛骨色相隨意所匠，冥會通神。嘗閱張彥遠《名畫記》，知當日供奉明皇朝圖有玉花驄、照夜白，每神往，以不得一見真蹟為憾，且未卜淪落何所也。近有以黃公望《富春山居》等圖求售者，黃蹟固屬僞作，而得幹所畫《照夜白》卷，神采飛騰，宛睹沛艾名種，為幹手筆無疑，因命購藏之。既以喜獲償夙願，而因王得羊，遭逢良復不偶云。乾隆丙寅仲冬月望前三日御識。 [印]：乾、隆

Who identified this celestial horse when it was mistakenly used to pull a cart?
It must be someone looking out of his window.
I am thinking of the dusty winds of northern China,
Where grasses are short, the livestock fat.

This poem was composed this autumn for a horse painting by Qiu Ying (ca. 1495-1552). Having acquired this painting by Han Gan, I feel Han's brush techniques are even more powerful. The mounting paper in front of the painting is admirably ancient, so I write my poem on it. [Qianlong] inscribed again on the third day of the twelfth month [of the bingyin year] (Jan. 13, 1747).[3] [Seals]: Ji xia yiqing, Qianlong chenhan

Night-shining White was highly praised in ancient times.
Han Gan depicted this horse of the horses.
Loyal to its master,
The horse had braved bitter coldness in battlefields.
When the horse is quiet, don't irritate it.
A good horseman doesn't even put a saddle on it.
In the grazing lands of northern Hebei,
It needs an expert eye to distinguish a good horse.

Imperially inscribed in the spring of the dingchou year (1757), composed on the same rhyme scheme as the earlier poem. [Seals]: Bide, Lang run

Night-shining White was the favorite of [the Tang emperor] Minghuang [i.e., Xuanzong, r. 712–756].
Its bone structure shows that it is a good horse.
Han Gan emphasized its spirit in his depiction,
And showed how it carried [Xuanzong] on his flight to Shu.
That famous painting is no longer extant;
This present scroll bears some characters written by the Southern Tang [emperor, Li Yu, r. 961–75].
This fine scroll is lucky enough to be preserved.
It will be treasured at an emperor's table side.

Han Gan's horse painting is of the divine class, so I have composed this poem for it. Recorded by Wei Su. [Seal]: Linchuan Wei Su

9. Jie Hong 揭汯 (1304–1373), 8 columns in standard script, undated:

Han Gan is unequalled in horse painting.
He once painted [Emperor] Minghuang's Night-shining White.
The horse is as white as a snowy cloud,
And when the horse runs, its hooves are faster than a bird's wings.
It cannot bear to be chained to a post;
Its ambition is to run a thousand miles.
When [the Emperor] toured Mount Li after banquets,
His imperial court was surrounded by colorful banners.
But this happiness did not last;
The Emperor was forced to flee to Shu [Sichuan].
All these events are history,
But viewing the painting makes me sentimental.

[Signed] Jie Hong of Yuzhang [in Jiangxi Province]

韓幹畫馬世無敵，貌得明皇照夜白。

10. Zhang Jixian 張繼先 (unidentified[4]), 5 columns in standard script, undated:

Recognizing a fine horse is like recognizing a fine jade.
People today only depict horses skin deep;
Master Han [Gan] captured the spirit of a horse.
The horse is as majestic as a dragon.
The image of a good horse is indeed difficult to paint,
But in master Han's painting, the horse is true to life.
I know what a good horse is after viewing this painting.
Night-shining White is really a unique horse in history.

[Signed] Zhang Jixian, a foolish and inept man from Nanyang [in Henan province].

11. Mo Shi’an 莫士安 (late 14th–early 15th c.), 15 columns in standard script, undated; 5 seals:

Emperor] Xuanzong [r. 712-756] loved horses;
He kept a huge number of them in his stable.
Among the horses, Night-shining White was the best.
Its body was snowy white and bore no dust.
No other horse could compete with it in appearance.
When its rider used the whip, it ran like lightening.
The Emperor was happy to see this horse,
But he forgot the difficulties of the country.
Banners held by the imperial guards seemed brighter
In the spring-time imperial garden
Where [the Emperor's concubine] Yuhuan [i.e., Yang Guifei] picked crabapple blossoms.
The Emperor and Yuhuan indulged themselves.
[Xuanzong] treasured Night-shining White just as he doted on his concubines,
So he ordered Cao Pa to paint a picture of the horse.
Too much favor made the horse lonely.
How could it stop galloping?
Beside the throne the horse stood in attendance.
It also carried the Emperor in his flight to Shu [Sichuan].
The Tang army was resentful of Yuhuan.
She was executed in Mawei Po [Sichuan] against the Emperor's will.
The roads of Shu were bad, so during his escape,
The emperor seldom rode his horse.
[Later], Han Gan painted another painting of the horse.
The speed of the horse was elegantly indicated.
The stars in the sky became less bright,
And the beauty [i.e., Yang Guifei] had been dead for a long time.
The spirit of the horse has not changed over the years.
Captured in the painting, its grace has been transmitted to later generations.

[Signed] Mo Shi’an from Wuxing [in Zhejiang Province] [Seals]: Zhongzhu Suo, Yinqiao yingsheng, Guilin sheng, Mo shi Shi’an, Weigong

天寶君王憐駿材，四十萬疋皆龍[馬某]。

一經拂拭真難比，鞍策銀光射秋水。
馳騁都忘國步艱，精神屢動天顔喜。
南苑霓旌三月新，玉環醉逐海棠塵。
驕嘶直過落花去，紅雨白雲迷好春。
時當妃子同愛惜，詔許將軍貌蹤跡。
愛惜恩多易寂寥，蹤跡年深豈蕭瑟。
白玉墀邊立仗雄，馬嵬坡下踏秋風。
六軍令發雲霄上，匹練香沉泥土中。
蜀道崎嶇龍失隊，載得君王赴西内。
皇帝移軍控馭稀，弟子入室臨摹類。
青絲絡腦黃金鏣，追風逸氣猶飄飄。
當時多少飽蒭豆，按舞却應豬龍妖。
天上房星芒色改，玉骨冰銷已千載。
畫靈不受秋壑羈，別向人間露光彩。

12. Chu Weishan 楚惟善 (active early 14th c.), 11 columns in standard script, dated 1320; 2 seals:
I have once read Shaoling's [i.e., Du Fu, 712-770] poem on viewing a horse painting by Cao Pa. In the poem is a sentence saying that [Cao Pa had] painted emperor Xuanzong's [horse] Night-shining White. So the original version of this painting was by Cao Pa. Cao Pa and Han Gan were both famous in the Tang dynasty for their horse paintings but [Han] Gan was a student of Cao Pa, so it would not be too surprising if he had copied this painting from his mentor. Viewers need not doubt this. [Du Fu also said that Han] Gan was good at depicting the flesh rather than the bone structure of a horse. This argument is supported by the present scroll. Alas! The horse is just a horse, but because of the emperor's favor, it was praised in poems and depicted in paintings, and its fame has lasted for hundreds of years. Also for this reason, the painting has been greatly treasured. [If the emperor went out of his palace], the imperial insignia and chariots preceded him, his retinue followed him. On a good day they might travel 50 li [about 16 miles]. Sometimes [the emperor] rode his horse. Words fail to describe such events [which, nonetheless, are vividly depicted in paintings]. Five days prior to the Qingming Festival [the first day of the fourth lunar month] in the gengshen year of the Yanyou reign era (May 9, 1320), inscribed by Chu Weishan, Baochen, from Dongjun [Zhaocheng, Shandong Province].

嘗讀少陵“觀曹將軍畫馬”詩，有“曾貌先帝照夜白”之句，則是圖本出曹霸。然曹霸、韓幹俱以工畫馬名於唐，韓實霸之弟子，而霸固幹之師也。以弟子摹倣厥師，亦豈無是理歟？觀者勿以此為疑。第誦“幹惟畫肉不畫骨”，質諸是圖益驗。噫！馬微物也，以上所好，至使形於歌詩，見之圖畫，歷千百年使人寳其圖。不翅“金璧鵉車在前，屬車在後，吉行五十里，師行三十里，朕乘千里馬獨先安之？”以是圖參是詔，又有以知漢文之未易及也。時延祐庚申清明前五日，東郡楚惟善伯珤臣父跋。 [印]：楚氏寳臣、惟善

How can they be restrained by mundane hands?
[Han] Gan had a unique understanding of such horses,
And so he painted a picture of one.
Unrolling the scroll, I see the horse's spirit,
As it neighs against west winds.
The horse is not content to rest in its stable,
But strains to race against the setting sun.
Now I know the intention of the painter
And remember a similar ambition described in the immortal Po's [Su Shi, 1037-1101] poem.
A descendant of Xicun, Gai Miao

天馬來西極，豈受人間羈？
幹亦獨何心，筆諸圖畫為。
橫披覩神異，宛若迎風嘶。
睠此奮迅閑廐下，直恐勢與落日爭分馳。
廼知作者意在萬里外，童年記得坡仙詩。

14. Zheng Guigao 鄭桂高 (active mid-14th c.), 10 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1340:

""[Cao Ba] once painted Emperor [Xuanzong's] favorite horse Night-shining White;
For three days, the Dragon Pool had lightening over it."" This couplet [from Du Fu's (712-770) poem] describes this painting, although Shaoling [Du Fu] also criticized [Han] Gan for depicting the flesh of a horse while neglecting its bone structure. While this is genuine trace, studies may be carried further. Touching the scroll, I feel sentimental and compose the following quatrain:

One neigh can silence ten thousand horses.
This ancient paper vividly conveys his spirit.
If people could find a seal of [the official] Wang Ya [died 835] on the scroll,
They would have agreed this is a genuine painting handed down from the past.

Written by Zheng Guigao in the gengchen year of the Zhiyuan reign era (1340).

“曾貌先帝照夜白，龍池三日飛霹靂。”其此之謂歟。“幹惟畫骨（點去）肉不畫骨，”少陵固亦云尔。真迹收附良可攷，參之近印尤信。撫卷增慨之餘，惟（點去）為賦一絕云：“一噴能瘖萬馬群，幾何年紙轉精神。可堪認得王涯印，信是流傳舊本真。”時至元庚辰，括人鄭桂高書。

15. Zeng Lu 曾魯 (1319–1372), 5 columns in standard script, undated; 3 seals:

Han Gan is number one in painting horses,
And he has depicted Night-shining White.
This valuable painting has passed down for seven-hundred years.
Formerly in the family collection of Jia [Jia Sidao, 1213-1275], [I have now] acquired it.
This noble horse refuses to be bridled;
A celestial steed, its hooves fly in the wind.
It should cross layers of ice
To enjoy the lush grasses and forests there.

[Signed] Zeng Lu from Nanfeng [in Jiangxi Province]. [Seals]: Zhuci Zhai, Qunyu Waishi, Zeng shi dezhi

韓幹畫馬誇第一，曾貌開元照夜白。
至寶流傳七百年，賈家舊物□家得。
君看此馬不受羈，夭矯勢欲凌風飛。
會當蹴踏曾冰去，豐草長林從所之。

南豐曾魯 [印]：屬辭齋、羣玉外史、曾氏得之

16. Lin Tangchen 林唐臣 (late 14th–early 15th c.), 11 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 3 seals:

I have heard that Night-shining White was painted by Cao Ba.
His student Han Gan also painted the same subject.
Defying restraint, the horse wanted to prance and fly,
While lightening flashed over the Dragon Pool.
During the Kaiyuan [reign era of Emperor Xuanzong, 713-41] the empire was at peace.
The steed was well-fed, but it neighed and yearned for a long trip.
No one expected the flight to Jian Ge [in Sichuan].
The Emperor indulged himself in his palace.
In the candlelight of the Chenxiang Pavilion,
The spring snow luster of the horse was like a piece of silk.
It is difficult to depict such a horse,
But [Han] Gan was divinely inspired.
And this painting has passed down for seven hundred years.
A single sheet of paper reveals his superb techniques.
Do not show this painting lightly to every visitor,
Since vulgar eyes cannot appreciate its true value.

[Signed] Lin Tangchen from Boling [in Hebei Province]. [Seals]: Boling sheng, Meixue Zhai, Lin Tangchen Yuankai shi tushu yin

吾聞《照夜馬圖》出曹霸，弟子韓幹亦曾畫。
金羈怒掣欲飛舞，龍池霹靂驚變化。
想當開元無事時，飽秣長鳴思遠馳。
未論萬騎入劍閣，要與八駿遊瑤池。
沉香亭前秉燭夕，匹練春雪光相射。
畫工如山貌不得，幹也天機有真迹。
世運七易年七百，片紙蕭瑟留粉墨。
□君慎勿輕示客，俗眼多應按圖索，
千金駿骨無人識。
博陵林唐臣 [印]：博陵生、梅雪齋、林唐臣元愷氏圖書印

17. Xu Zunsheng 徐尊生 (active mid-14th c.), 8 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 2 seals:

The celestial steed has a silky luster.
Being tethered, it cannot gallop.
Lifting its hooves, it neighs with a temper,
And almost tears its reins apart.
Don't you see the lush grasses in the prairie?
Herds of horses are washed clean in a river.
Their bodies do not bear a particle of dust,
And they have never been restrained.
Master Han [Gan] portrayed the true spirit of horses.
He seemed to understand the feeling of the animal.
Better to let the horse go as it likes.
When I am old, I would also like to live in a place I like.

[Signed] Xu Zunsheng from Yanling [in Zhejiang Province] [Seals]: Zunsheng, Xu Danian

天閑神驥匹練光，繫著柳上難騰驤。
揚騣仰首意鬱懣，險不迸斷青絲韁。
君不見沙苑春深草肥潔，羣浴滄波袞晴雪。
纎毫渾未惹塵泥，頃刻何曾受羈紲。
韓生筆到天機精，能通馬語知馬情。
不如縱靶任本性，老去甘與駑駘并。

嚴陵徐尊生 [印]：尊生、徐大年

18. Zhang Shimeng 章師孟 (dates unknown), 4 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 1 seal:

During the Kaiyuan reign era (713–41) there were good horses, but this did not help prevent [An Lushan's] rebellion in the Tianbao reign era (742–755). During the Shaoxing reign era (1131–62), men viewed this painting of a good horse, but this was of no use in resisting the chaos [of the Jurchen invasion] during the Jingkang reign era (1126–27). The painting has survived, but the cultural setting has changed. [Signed] A former jinshi degree holder, Zhang Shimeng [Seal]: Zijia yisi

開元有良馬，而無濟於天寶之囏。紹興觀良馬圖，而無援於靖康之變。丹青顧存，文物復安在哉！吾於是而重感。前進士章師孟 [印]：自家意思

19. Shen Deqian 沈德潛 (1673–1769), 13 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 2 seals:
When General Cao [Ba] painted a picture of Night-shining White,
Lightening flashed over the Dragon Pool for ten days.
His student Han Gan also did a painting [of the same subject];
His brush technique rivals that of his tutor.
Displaying braveness in fierce battles,
The horse could not endure bridle or bit.
Flesh underlain by bone--it possesses both grace and strength.
The horse expresses its power in its neigh.
Du Ling [Du Fu, 712–770] was playful when he made derogatory remarks.
Master Su [Su Shi, 1036–1101] repudiated [Du Fu's comments] when he viewed Han's painting.
The painting official [i.e., Han Gan] had keenly observed herds of horses.
He surpassed Chen Hong [active ca. 725-756] because he understood horses.
This scroll has been passed down for a thousand years.
It is a treasured item in the Imperial Collection.
Again returned to the Palace precincts, it is treasured like a one-foot-wide jade disk.
There are depictions for each of the ten horses of the [Tang] imperial household.
These celestial steeds came from the west.
Dragons in disguise,
These horses could gallop one thousand li a day.
But if they were not depicted by Han Gan,
Who else could depict their majestic poses?
This expert painter painted good horses.
Unrolling the scroll, I am amazed by the fine match.

Respectfully inscribed by the official Shen Deqian [Seals]: Yiduo hongyun, Chen Deqian yin

曹將軍貌照夜白，龍池十日飛霹靂。
弟子韓幹亦有圖，筆力幾與師相敵。
籋雲迣鳥氣無前，那肯低頭就羈靮？
肉中有骨藏丰稜，想像長鳴勢騰擲。
杜陵游戲作貶語，蘇子披圖重推激。
天閑萬匹皆臣師，氣敓陳閎欲陵轢。
此卷流傳已千載，歸之内府珍尺璧。
天家十駿有圖畫，月窟西來過重驛。
超驤俱是千里足，豈數當年好頭赤。

[3] The term “zaishengming” in the dating of this inscription refers to the third day of the month. Our gratitude to James C. Y. Watt for this reference.

行此道，忌淹污、經死亡之家，不得與人同床寢，衣服不假人，禁食五辛及一切肉。又對近婦人尤禁之甚，令人神亡魂亡，生邪失性，災及三世，死為下鬼，常當燒香於寢床之首也。上清瓊宮玉符，乃是太極上宮四真人，所受於太上之道，當須精誠潔心，澡除五累，遺穢污之塵濁，杜淫欲之失正，目存六精，凝思玉真，香煙散室，孤身幽房，積毫累著，和魂保中，仿佛五神，遊生三宮，豁空競於常輩，守寂默以感通者，六甲之神不逾年而降已也。子能精修此道，必破券登仙矣。信而奉者為靈人，不信者將身沒九泉矣。

上清六甲虛映之道，當得至精至真之人，乃得行之，行之既速，致通降而靈氣易發。久勤修之，坐在立亡，長生久視，變化萬端，行廚卒致也。

九疑真人韓偉遠，昔受此方於中岳宋德玄。德玄者，周宣王時人，服此靈飛六甲得道，能一日行三千里，數變形為鳥獸，得真靈之道。今在嵩高，偉遠久隨之，乃得受法，行之道成，今處九疑山，其女子有郭芍藥、趙愛兒、王魯連等。并受此法而得道者，復數十人。或游玄洲，或處東華，方諸臺今見在也。南岳魏夫人言此云：“郭芍藥者，漢度遼將軍陽平郭騫女也，少好道，精誠真人因授其六甲。趙愛兒者，幽州刺史劉虞別駕漁陽趙該婦也，好道得尸解，後又受此符。王魯連者，魏明帝城門校尉范陵王伯綱女也，亦學道，一旦忽委婿李子期，入陸渾山中，真人又授此法。子期者，司州魏人，清河王傅者也，其常言此婦狂走云，一旦失所在。”

上清六甲靈飛隱道，服此真符，遊行八方，行此真書，當得其人。按四極明科，傳上清內書者，皆列盟奉[貝危]啟誓乃宣之，七百年得付六人，過年限足不得復出洩也。其受符者，皆對齋七日，[貝危]有經之師。上金六兩，白素六十尺，金鐶六雙，青絲六兩，五色繒各廿二尺，以代剪髮歃血登壇之誓，以盟奉行靈符，玉名不洩之信矣。違盟負信，三祖父母獲風刀之考，詣積夜之河，摙蒙山巨石，填之水津。有經之師受[貝危]，當施散於山林之寒栖，或投東流之清遠，不得私用。割損以贍己利，不遵科法，三官考察，死為下鬼。","Label Strip

《靈飛經》四十三行墨蹟在“上清瓊宮陰陽通真祕符”之前，即海昌陳氏《藏真帖》祖本。其最後十二行即[此字點去]是《藏真》之所闕也。按《靈飛經》為唐開元廿六年[644]玉真長公主奉敕寫，元袁清容[桷]始定為鍾紹京書，其說蓋本“思陵於經生書不收入內府”一語，然亦未能斷定為鍾書也。明萬歷三十五年[1607]冬，董思翁得之吳用卿[吳廷]家，後思翁寫《蓮華經》必展閱一過，珍如球璧。庚戌[1610]歲思翁出所寫《蓮華》七卷，質于太常陳公增城[陳瓛]所，每卷議值百金，而虞太常有難色，乃以《靈飛》一卷輔之。越十六年，思翁遣其子持金來索《蓮華》甚急，而陳氏正在勒石，不便遽反，往復不已。太常之子湖廣參政名之伸者，遂將《靈飛》抵《蓮華》，以塞其意。參政私將《靈飛》割留四十三行藏于家，意作“雷煥留劍”公案，而思翁竟未檢及也。至戊辰歲[1628]，參政遇思翁於西湖昭慶寺，問《靈飛》無恙否？則已作王、謝家燕矣。自此四十三行藏于陳氏，傳至體齋中丞名用敷者，亦能世守。吾鄉秦味經司寇[秦蕙田]素聞《靈飛》名，從中丞借觀。中丞故為司寇門生，不得已乃贈之。司寇既得，祕不示人。歿後，其子靜軒太史稍稍誇于人間。中丞任安徽布政時，偶過錫山，以計賺歸，仍為陳氏所有，真藝林佳話也。余老友陳無軒[焯]學博曾載入《寓賞編》，與余備述甚詳。是細麻紙本，甚完好，都四十三行，計六百八十五字。較諸全本，雖僅吉光片羽，而與石本對勘，則結體用筆毫髮不爽，至於精神奕奕，自在游行，又非石本所能幾及也。余年來奔走衣食，以不獲一見為恨。後見曾氏[恆德]《滋蕙堂帖》，乃知即從《藏真》翻刻，故亦缺此十二行，並作趙松雪偽跋於後，則較《藏真》有霄壤之隔別矣。余前年冬在邗江[此字點去]上，知為吳餘山文學所購，今中書舍人謝君若農[恭銘]借以上石。嘉慶辛未[1811]十月廿日過楓涇鎮，始觀于若農齋中。摩挲石刻幾三十年，一朝得見真蹟，喜不自勝。他日尚擬從餘山再乞一觀，僅模此十二行以補陳、曾兩家之闕，不亦大快事耶！錢梅溪泳《履園叢話》一則。

On the sixteenth of the tenth lunar month in the winter of the gengzi year [November 1, 1240] Liu Man of Yangmen requested a poem on the eve of his departure and I wrote this for him in admiration of his administrative ability.

To the right is a farewell poem to Liu of Yangmen [Liu Man], a work by Secretariat Prince Yelü Wenzheng [Yelü Chucai]. The Prince was born in the gengxu year of the Mingchang reign era of the Jin period [1190]. Twenty-six years later he became a subject of our dynasty in the yihai year of the Zhenyou reign era [1215]. In his inscription after the poem he said it was the winter of the gengzi year [1240]. Tracing back from gengzi to yihai, there were additional twenty-five years. Therefore the Prince created this work at the age of fifty-one. At that time, the Jin subjects had come under the new rulers just recently, and most of the laws and systems had not been established. The newly acquired counties and prefectures were often divided into nobles’ and aristocrats’ vassalages. Since no pacification policy was implemented, most people ran away, to which [the poetic line about] people fled their homes seems to refer. How deeply the Prince cared about his subjects! The Prince was a profound, serious man, who did not commend people casually. Since he singled out Yangmen as an able administrator worthy of praise, we could tell how well Yangmen governed. The Prince was named Chucai, zi Jinqing, an eighth-generation grandson of Yelü Tuyu (active early 10th c.), Prince Dongdan of the Liao dynasty.

右送劉陽門詩一章，中書耶律文正王之所作也。王生於金明昌庚戌，生二十六年歸我國朝，實貞祐乙亥。今詩後題云：“庚子之冬。”以庚子上溯乙亥又二十五年，則王五十一歲作此也。當是時，金民新附，法制多未定，所得州縣或割裂為諸王貴族湯沐邑。撫綏之道不至，民多亡去，所謂黎庶逋逃，似指此也。王之不忘吾民者，何其至哉。王沈毅慎許可，而獨以能吏稱陽門，則陽門之為政可知矣。王名楚材，字晉卿，耶律氏，遼東丹王突欲之八世孫，為相二十年，軍國之務悉委焉。所居近玉泉山，因以自號云。金華後學宋濂謹題。 [印]： 金華、宋氏景濂、潛谿宋濂。

It is said in the Catalogue of Paoweng’s Family Collection [by Wu Kuan, 1435–1504] that the calligraphy of Academician Song [Song Lian] was pure with an ancient flair and well disciplined. Lang Renbao [Lang Ying, 1487–1566] said Song’s cursive calligraphy evoked the images of circling dragons and dancing phoenixes. Li Rihua (1565–1635) said in his Miscellaneous Notes from the Liuyan Studio that masters of the Tang and the Song dynasties all specialized in semi-cursive and cursive calligraphy. During his own dynasty Song Jinglian [Song Lian] was the only calligrapher good at the small standard script. He Qiaoyuan (1558–1631) said in his Things to Be Kept in Famous Mountains [Mingshan cang] that Song never stopped practicing calligraphy from youth to old age, writing in a lush manner. Upon a closer look, one can see several characters written on a single grain. The above remarks are gathered from calligraphers’ biographies. His life in service and retreat has been clearly stated in the History of the Ming Dynasty. There is no need to repeat. On the twentieth of the fifth lunar month in the eighth year of the Qianlong reign era [July 11, 1743] Li Shizhuo inscribed this. [Seals]: Shizhuo, Yinxian shi

3. Dai Liang 戴良 (1317–1383), 26 columns in standard script, dated 1349; 4 seals:

Having read such poems as “Grandly Lofty” [Song gao] and “The Multitudes of the People” [Zhengmin], I realized that in ancient times people in charge of national affairs sometimes resorted to poetry to exhort the world.[5] In view of Shen Bo’s (active 9th–8th c. B.C.) administration and Zhong Shanfu’s [Fan Muzhong, active 9th–8th c. B.C.] journey to Qi, Administrator Jifu [Xi Jia, active 9th–8th c. B.C.], a senior minister of the [Western] Zhou dynasty (ca. 1100-771 B.C.), composed these two poems for them. His praise of them was the highest, whereas his remarks not directly referred to them were meant to exhort the world. Consequently at the time everyone admonished himself to be good. As a result, worthies and talents arrived in quantities and the capable continued to be employed. King Xuan’s (r. 827–782 B.C.) virtue lay in securing the prosperity of a dynastic revival. As to his original inspiration, wouldn’t it be the exhortation to be good expressed in those two poems? Then Master Yelü’s farewell poem to Marquis Liu must have been inspired by this. When Master Yelü served as Secretariat, a Marquis Liu was leaving to take a post in charge of Yangmen and asked him for a poem. He therefore composed one of four lines for him as a gift and inscribed at the end, “What I admire about the Marquis is his administrative ability.” His admiration of someone’s administrative ability could make an exhortation to the world. Later on Marquis Liu, as a military commander-in-chief, led his army to vanquish the Jin dynasty and sacked [its capital] Bian [present-day Kaifeng, Henan], and became a celebrated minister of the time. In addition, between the Zhongtong (1260–1263) and the Zhiyuan (1264–1294) reigns groups of men of great talent and distinguished virtue appeared over and again. What can we say about poetry as exhortation to the world?

One day Marquis Liu’s great-grandson Zhizuo [Liu Shiji, active mid-14th c.] came to my hometown as Assistant Magistrate and, having shown me this poem by the Master, asked me to inscribe it below. That was how I realized that the Master had a profound understanding of the ancient’s intent. When the Master served as Secretariat, the north and the south were divided and the nation had not been unified. The logistics of dispatching the armies and transporting military provisions left him no spare moment any day. But just because Marquis Liu was an able administrator, he managed to put aside his official duties to compose a poem to establish his reputation, through which he eagerly spread his exhortation to the world. His intent, therefore, could measure up to Administrator Jifu’s, and his poem would go down history together with “Grandly Lofty,” “The Multitudes of the People,” and the likes. If this poem could indeed be passed on, Marquis Liu’s name will also be perpetuated like those of Shen Bo and Zhong Shanfu. Seeing this, how could people of later times not exhort good deeds even harder? The Master’s name is Chucai, zi Jinqing, last name Yelü. A descendant of the Khitan imperial family, he came to serve the great Yuan. His distinguished accomplishments, as well as his literary refinement and powerful calligraphy, have been permanently recorded in dynastic histories, so I will not enumerate them here. In the ninth year of the Zhizheng reign era, on the fifteenth of the intercalary [seventh] lunar month in the jichou year [August 29, 1349], Dai Liang from Pujiang [in Zhejiang] respectfully inscribed this.

予讀崧高烝民諸詩，然後知古之秉國鈞者，未嘗不假詩以為世勸也。蓋尹吉甫之佐周也，以申伯之治，謝仲山甫之徂齊，為作此二詩以送之。其所以褒美之者至矣；非直褒美之也，蓋將以為世勸焉爾。故當是時，人皆以善自厲，卒致賢才輩出，用能不墜。宣王之美，以保有中興之盛跡，其故岂不由二詩有以勸其為善之心哉。然則耶律公之送劉侯也，庶幾有得於此乎？耶律公居中書時，有劉侯者，方出治陽門，因其索詩，為作一章，章四句以遺之，且題其末曰：“予之褒美於侯者，所以賞其能治也。賞其能治也者，乃所以為世勸也。”其後劉侯既以上將帥師，蹶金破汴，為時名臣。而中統至元之間，長材懋德，亦層見而疊出。詩之所以為世勸者又何如哉？一日，劉侯之曾孫之佐來貳吾邑，因出公是詩以相示，請志下方，予於是知公深得古人之遺意矣。蓋公之在中書也，當夫南北分裂之際，區宇未混一之時，戈甲之營調，芻餉之轉輸，顧方日不暇給，而公乃力排所務，獨以劉侯能治之故，形諸賦詠，樹之風聲汲汲焉，欲藉是以為世勸之資。則公之是心也，雖質之尹吉甫可也；其所為詩，又安得不與崧高烝民諸篇並傳於世哉。誠使是詩之有傳，則劉侯之名亦將與申伯、仲山甫同垂不朽矣。後之觀者，可不益勸於為善乎？公名楚材，字晉卿，耶律其氏也。以契丹世胄，入仕皇元。其高勳盛烈，與夫辭章之美麗、字畫之遒劲，固已銘之太常，書之太史，茲不著。至正九年其歲己丑閏月望日浦江戴良謹題。 [印]： 遜志齋、東陽、戴良之印、叔能

5. Zheng Tao 鄭濤 (1315–ca. 1380), 7 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1352:

Every word in the writings of the ancients is intended to instruct the world; none is uttered casually. The farewell poem for Liu of Yangmen, had it been composed by someone other than Master Yelü, would have been nothing but sad expressions over parting. Only the Master admired Liu’s administrative ability. Furthermore, his statement that abusive officials and greedy functionaries feel dread is as compelling as the autumnal frost and the scorching sun, which inspires fear and awe. Even those who want to see it may not have a chance, let alone to handle it in person. The mere refinement of his calligraphy is not enough to measure his achievement. In spring, the first lunar month of the renchen year in the Zhizheng reign era [January 18–February 15, 1352] Zheng Tao from Yimen [in Jiangxi] inscribed this with respect.

古人述作一言一字皆有關於世教，不輕發也。耶律公之送劉陽門，使他人為之，不過淒涼離別之辭耳。公獨賞其能治，且有暴官貪吏知懼之言，凜然如秋霜烈日，可畏可仰，人欲見之而不可得，矧狎玩之耶。區區字畫之工，蓋不足以論公也。至正壬辰春正月義門鄭濤敬題。

Yelü Wenzheng’s [Yelü Chucai’s] life in service and retreat has been recorded in history. His extant autographs are only this one or two, unlike Songxue [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322] and the likes whose names are perpetuated through brush and ink. The poetic colophons attached to the end of the scroll were all written by famous people of their times one after another. There used to be Liu Jing’an’s seals. Unfortunately they were cut off with only four left. Jing’an must be Marquis Liu’s great-grandson, which the remarks in the colophons indicate.

The greatness of Prince Yelü Wenzheng’s [Yelü Chucai’s] career as prime minister was only second to that of Zhuge Wuhou [Zhuge Liang, 181–234]. His calligraphy is profound and vigorous with the awesome spirit of Mount Tai. Never in any connoisseur’s catalogue [of artworks] has Wenzheng ever been mentioned. This is indeed the only specimen of his in our nation’s calligraphic masterworks. Having lasted for seven hundred years, it appears as compelling as a living creature. In terms of the loftiness of his calligraphy, it is as if he were writing in the styles of Yan Lugong [Yan Zhenqing, 709–785], Su Wenzhong [Su Shi, 1037–1101], and Huang Wenjie [Huang Tingjian, 1045–1105] simultaneously. I once saw Luo Liangfeng’s [Luo Pin’s, 1733–1799] copy of a portrait of the Prince by a Yuan painter. The figure, in a tall hat and an ornate official robe with his beard almost three feet long, has the bearing of a founding member of a dynasty. It had over a dozen colophons written by famous people of the Qianlong (1736–1795) and Jiaqing (1796–1820) reign eras. This scroll only has a quatrain, but his encouragement to Liu of Yangmen is serious and thoughtful. His final statement, “Wouldn’t abusive officials and wily functionaries feel ashamed,” really shows how deeply he cared about the people. This poem is not recorded in [Yelü’s] Anthology of the Limpid-minded Man, so it is particularly precious. When my deceased friend Master Wang Zhongque, Guowei (1877–1927), was compiling the Prince’s chronology, he used this scroll as a source material. Otherwise it has never been mentioned anywhere. I once went outside the gate of the Yihe Yuan palace compound to pay homage to the Prince’s portrait and his tomb. Lost in thought every now and then, I couldn’t bear to leave.

Prince Yelü Wenzheng [Yelü Chucai] topped all other accomplished ministers of the Yuan dynasty. His Anthology of the Limpid-minded Man, included in the Siku [Siku quanshu, Encyclopedic collection of four literary categories, completed in 1781], is also the top choice of Yuan literature. Although the poem in this scroll is not recorded in his anthology, his sincerity in supervising officials and taking care of the people is revealed between the lines. Even viewed six hundred years later, it inspires awe and respect. That’s how deeply moving it is. The Yuan rule over China did not last a hundred years. Inheriting the declining Jin dynasty (1115–1234), it managed to unify the whole realm. I sometimes think, wasn’t it owing to the distinguished services of its sagacious administrators that it was able to establish national stability and receive people’s support? Modern scholars tend to insist on ethnic discrimination, but the mentality that “He who cares about me is my ruler and he who abuses me is my enemy” will not change through eternity. Didn’t Huang Chao (died 884) and Li Zicheng (1606-1645) appear a Han ethnic in every respect? But weren’t the catastrophes caused by them even more gruesome than the one caused by the Yuan barbarians? His remark “Wouldn’t abusive officials and wily functionaries feel ashamed” is obviously the words of a compassionate man. Song Jinglian’s [Song Lian’s] colophon was written prior to the Ming period. Dai Shuliang [Dai Liang] and Gong Zijing [Gong Su] were renowned scholars of the Yuan dynasty, whose anthologies are both in my family’s collection. Only the name of Zheng of Yimen [Zheng Tao] was somewhat obscure. Mr. [Zhou] Xiangyun (1878–1943) acquired this treasure and gave me a treat for my eyes. I therefore wrote this seriously.

行書右軍四事",https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/40509,"Zhao Mengfu
趙孟頫","Artist’s inscription and signature (37 columns in semi-cursive and cursive scripts)

In the beginning [Wang] Xizhi did not excel in calligraphy; he was no match for Yu Yi or Xi Yin. Toward the end of his life, however, he reached the highest peak of this art. Once he wrote a letter to Yu Liang in “draft cursive” script which Liang showed to Yu Yi. Admiring it, Yu sent a letter to Xizhi and said, “I once owned ten sheets of ‘draft cursive’ writing by Boying [Zhang Zhi, active about 150] which were lost when I fled north China across the Yangzi River. I deeply regret that such excellent works are gone forever. When I happened to see your letter to my brother, however, as brilliant as if written by a god, my former pleasure and appreciation were revived.

When Xizhi left his position as the Prefect of Kuaiji, he resided at the foot of Mount Ji. One day an old woman was going to market with ten-odd hexagonal fans. Wang asked her the price and she answered that each cost twenty coins, whereupon Wang took a brush and wrote five characters on each fan. The old woman sorrowfully said that her whole family’s livelihood depended on those fans and asked why Wang wrote on them and ruined their value. Wang told her to tell the buyers that the calligraphy was by Leader of the Right Army Wang [Wang Xizhi] and to ask for one hundred coins each. The old woman went to the market and a crowd gathered and bought them all. She then brought ten–odd more blank fans for Wang to write on. He only smiled and did not answer.

Xizhi once wrote a memorial to Emperor Mudi of Jin. The emperor ordered Zhang Yi to make an exact copy. Then the emperor himself wrote a reply upon it. Xizhi did not notice at first but, after a careful look, recognized the substitution. He sighed, “That fellow almost confused which one was authentic.”

Xizhi was extremely fond of [the graceful appearance of] geese. In Shanyin there was a Daoist monk who had raised a flock of more than ten fine geese. One morning Wang decided to take a small boat and go there. He was delighted with the geese and wanted to buy them, but the monk refused to sell. Wang tried in vain to persuade him. Finally, the monk told Wang that he loved Daoist philosophy and had always wanted a transcription of Laozi’s Dao de jing with its commentary by Heshanggong. He had already prepared the silk, but no one was qualified to write it. He asked if Wang would condescend to transcribe two chapters each from the Dao and De sections, for which he would repay Wang with the whole flock of geese. Wang stayed for half a day to write out the chapters, then he caged the geese and returned home.[1] Written by Ziang

羲之書始未有奇，殊不勝庾翼、郗愔。迨其末年乃造其極。嘗以章草答庾亮。亮以示翼。翼歎服。因與羲之書云：“吾昔有伯英章草書十紙，過江亡失,常痛妙迹永絕。忽見足下書[點去]答家兄書，煥若神明，頓還舊觀。”

羲之罷會稽，住蕺山下。一老嫗捉十許六角竹扇出市。王問：“一枚幾錢?”云：“直二十許。”右軍取筆書扇為五字。嫗大悵惋云：“舉家朝飱，唯仰於此，何乃書壞。”王云：“ 但言王右軍書，字索一百。”入市，市人競市去。姥復以十數扇來請書。王笑不答。

羲之嘗自書表與穆帝。帝使張翼寫效，一毫不異，題後答之。羲之初不覺，更詳看乃歎曰：“小人幾欲亂真。”

羲之性好鵞。山陰有一道士，養好鵝十餘。王清旦乘小船故往，意大願樂，乃告求市易。道士不與。百方譬說不能得。道士乃言：“性好道，久欲寫河上公老子。缣素早辦，而無人能書。府君若能自屈書 《道德經》 各兩章，便合羣奉之。”羲之便住半日，為寫畢，籠鵞而歸。子昂書。

The structural integrity and spirit of Grand Master Zhao’s [Zhao Mengfu’s] calligraphy surpasses those of the Song masters’. But in terms of self–containment, he was inferior to Tang masters. I have just seen his transcription of four anecdotes from Wang Xizhi’s life, which is no less elegant than the ancient masters’ calligraphy. On the seventeenth of the tenth lunar month of the wushen year [November 27, 1368] I viewed this at Zhang Yuandu’s (active 14th c.) Huanlü Xuan studio, Ni Zan.

In addition, his own manner resembled theirs too.

In the fifth lunar month of the gengwu year in the Longqing era [1570] I visited Grand Mentor Sha An twice and saw five pieces of Wenmin’s [Zhao Mengfu’s] calligraphy. Among them, his copy of the Seventeen Letters best captures the principles of Wang Xizhi’s calligraphy. The flowing energy and spontaneity of this scroll are also derived from Wang’s. Ni [Ni Zan, 1306–1374], the oddball, degraded him to the rank of Song calligraphers. Wasn’t he indeed an oddball! I presumptuously argue against it.

When the Administrator [Wang Xizhi] did calligraphy, his idea always preceded rules. These four anecdotes reveal his spirit in full. When the Recipient of Edicts [Zhao Mengfu] studied Wang’s methods, he focused on his idea, which this scroll well embodies. People of the past said that Ziang [Zhao Mengfu] got rid of all the faults of Yan’s [Yan Zhenqing’s, 709–784 or 785] and Liu’s [Liu Gongquan’s, 778–865] calligraphy and learned directly from the Jin masters, and that he was the only great one after Wang. This opinion was no mere flattery. Xiuyan Yinshi, Hu Shi’an, from Xishu [modern Sichuan Province]. [Seals]: Hu Shi’an yin, Chujing fu

Wenmin [Zhao Mengfu] lived about six hundred years ago. His writings in large and small semi–cursive and standard scripts, kept in both manuscript and rubbing forms, amount to hundreds. In terms of the condition of paper and ink and the preservation of the work’s spirit, none surpasses this scroll. I acquired it in the capital years ago and have treasured it ever since. Last winter I also acquired his long handscroll that transcribed the “Thousand-character Essay” in four different scripts, which could make an excellent pair with this piece.

I had this scroll and the Dingwu version of the Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering traced and carved on stone to be preserved in my Lanxue Zhai studio. I then did the same with the standard-script and cursive-script parts of the Thousand-character Essay in Four Scripts and placed them at the beginning of my compilation of calligraphic rubbings, the Chenglan Tang fatie. Thus the two most indelible masterpieces of Zhao Mengfu’s calligraphy in my collection are now preserved on stone to last forever. Viewers in the future should treasure them greatly.

[An incomplete transcription of “A Rhapsody on the Yellow Pavilion (Huang Lou fu)” by Su Che (1039–1112), translation from Department records]:

Zizhan [Su Shi, 1037–1101] and his guest ascended the Yellow Tower to enjoy themselves. The guest gazed upward, and then looked down with a sigh, “Ah! During the Yuanguang reign era (134-129 B.C.) of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–220 A.D.) the [Yellow] River collapsed the dikes at Huzi [present-day Puyang, Henan]. Turbulent water poured into Lake Juye [in Shandong] and caused the Huai and the Si Rivers to overflow, ravaging Liang [present-day Shangqiu, Henan, area] and Chu [present-day Hubei and Hunan] for over twenty years. Lower places turned into dirty swamps, while higher places became watery glades. People lived like fish and turtles; counties lost their administrative buildings. The Emperor [Wudi, r. 141–87 B.C.], after performing rituals in homage to Heaven atop Mount Tai [in Shandong], toured the east region. Feeling pity for the innocent people whose bodies drifting in water without being buried, he had the officials carry wood to fill up [the dikes]. There he built the Xuanfang Palace and composed the Song of Huzi, the sorrow of which lingered till today. Ah! This had gone through the vicissitude of a thousand years. The [Yellow] River ran east but overflowed to the south, and repeated the old scourge of the Han dynasty. [The water] encompassed the plains and the swamps into one, expecting the destruction of our city walls. A long stretch of the rugged Mount Lüliang [in Shanxi] blocked its front; four mountains linked together to circumscribe its expanse. The water whirled around instead of moving forward, circling the lone city like a sea. Aquatic creatures danced in the moat; sailboats came into view as one looked down. When the wind blew heavy, it terrified people like thundering drums. Indeed, the neglect of small but crucial places [in the dikes] led to the destruction of a whole town. Fortunately as winter arrived, the water retreated of its own accord. Drifting branches perched on tall trees; dead clams were left on once flooded ground. Hearing of the success of [the dikes] at [Lake] Chanyuan [in present-day Puyang, Henan], I wonder on whom I can depend but Heaven. At this moment, you and I in tall hats and fine clothes set the feast table. We drink to each other to the full of our spirit, as music plays and laughter ensues. How could this be fortuitous.

Zizhan said, “Those who are used to happiness do not know their happiness is happiness. They have to experience adversity in order to know it. You and I have leaned out of this tower and looked around to observe the grandeur of the universe. It walls its city with circling ranges of green mountains, and takes the long river as its sash. The field spreads out like a mat; mulberries and hemp flourish strong. Narrow paths crisscross [the field]; the yards and the cottages face forward and backward. Farmers and fishermen dot the riverbank; cattle and sheep roam the misty distance. As a fresh breeze arises, light clouds pile up. Mountains and rivers spread and converge, stretching a thousand miles in verdant lushness. Gazing east, [we see] mountains rise and fall one after another, running away with the river…. [Moonlight] penetrates the windows into the room, making people tremble with cold. It silences the din of the bustling crowds; one thus hears the sound of the vast, wavy river. Let’s dance with each other, drink volumes, forget our worries, and transcend all to ease ourselves. In addition, don’t you see those who used to live here? Earlier there were Xiang Ji (232–202 B.C.) and Liu Bei (161–223)[1] ; later came [Li] Guangbi (708-764) and [Zhang] Jianfeng (735–800). They had groups of warhorses and legions of fierce warriors. As they raised their arms and released a long whistle, the wind blew and the clouds forms. In the red pavilions and green towers girls danced and boys sang. When their momentum slacked to a halt and their strength was exhausted, everything turned into nothing. [Still] the mountains stand tall and the water runs deep, but grass has grown over the ruins. I asked the locals of old, [and was told that] they had vanished with nothing left. Therefore I, in your company, will lament over the passing of the ancients and the flooding of the [Yellow] River in the past. Knowing that changes will never cease, let’s drink to the end of the day.”

Upon these words, the guests laugh with relief and abandoned themselves to inebriation. As the Milky Way tilts and the moon glides down, we support one another on our way out.

子瞻與客遊於黃樓之上，客仰而望俯而嘆曰：“噫嘻!殆哉!在漢元光,河決瓠子, 腾蹙钜野，衍溢淮泗，梁楚受害二十餘歲。下者為污澤，上者為沮洳。民為魚鱉，郡縣無所。天子封祀太山，徜徉東方，哀民之無辜，流死不藏，使公卿負薪，以塞宣房。瓠子之歌，至今傷之。嗟惟此邦，俯仰千載，河東傾而南洩，蹈漢世之遺害。包原隰而為一，窺吾墉之摧敗。呂梁齟齬，橫絕乎其前，四山連屬，合圍乎其外。水洄洑而不盡[進]，環孤城以為海。舞魚龍於隍壑，閱帆檣於睥睨。方飄風之迅發，震鞞鼓之驚駭。誠蟻穴之不救，分閭閻之橫潰。幸冬日之既迫，水泉縮而[以]自退。棲流憐於喬木，遺枯蚌于水裔。聽澶淵之功，非天意吾誰賴。今我與公，冠冕裳衣，設幾几布筵，鬥酒相屬，飲酣作樂[樂作]，開口而笑，夫豈偶然也哉？”子瞻曰：“今夫安於樂者，不知樂之為樂也，必涉於害者而後知之。吾嘗與子憑茲樓而四顧，覽天宇之宏大，繚青山以為城，引長河而為帶。平皋衍其如席，桑麻蔚乎斾斾。畫阡陌之縱橫，分園廬之向背。放田漁於江浦，散牛羊於煙際。清風時起，微雲霮□ 。山川開闔，蒼莽千里。東望則連山參差，與水皆馳。 [2]飛楹而入戶，使人體寒而戰慄。息洶洶於群動，聽川流之蕩潏。可以起舞相命，一飲千石，遺弃憂患，超然自得。且子獨不見夫昔之居此者乎？前則項籍、劉備[戊]，後則光弼、建封。戰馬成群，猛士如[成]林。振臂長嘯，風動雲興。朱閣青樓，舞女歌童。勢窮力竭，化為虛空。山高水深，草生故墟。蓋將問其遺老，既次[已]灰滅而無餘矣。故吾將與子吊古人之既逝，閔河決於疇昔。知變化之無在，付杯酒以終日。”於是眾客釋然而笑，頹然而[就]醉，河傾月墮，扶擕而出。

In the empty grove the whistling wind makes the leaves dance;
The thatch pavilion is silent, the sun stands at high noon.
All day long the south wind caresses the green waves;
With a gauze cap of coarse hemp one feels no trace of summer's heat.
This rustic’s dwelling is near Yellow Crane Peak;
In the evening he enters a deserted grotto and listens to the mountain rain.[1]

Zhang Qiao (late 9th c.) of the Tang dynasty (618–907) once wrote a quatrain titled “On Wang Changling’s (690–756) Hall That Has Become Xu Tang’s (late 9th c.) Official Residence in Shangyuan,” which reads:

The guests of the Liuli Hall in those days
Have long ceased chanting, but their practice continues in later times.
After 140 years, trees in the courtyard have grown old;
Now they get to meet poets again.

[Wang] Changling was a native of Jiangning [modern Nanjing region], which later changed its name to Shangyuan. [Zhang] Qiao received his jinshi degree during the Xiantong reign (860–74). The gap between his and Changling’s times roughly corresponds to that mentioned in the poem. The so-called ""Liuli Hall"" was doubtless in Jinling (Nanjing), so it should be in the repertoire of Jiangnan painting. What I do not know is, several decades after the Xiantong era, for whom [Zhou] Wenju created this painting. Perhaps the drooping old pines are the only relics from the time of Wang [Changling] and Xu [Tang]. [Signed] Wang Yijian from Shanyin [in Zhejiang Province][1] [Seals]: Wang Lide fu, Huayin Yuan

唐張喬有“題上元許棠所任王昌齡廳”絕句云：“琉璃堂裡當時客，久絕吟聲繼後塵。百四十年庭樹老，如今重得見詩人。”昌齡，江寧人，江寧後改上元。喬，咸通間進士，略計去昌齡之時近遠亦與詩合。所謂琉璃堂者，在金陵無疑，故應入江南圖畫中。特未知後咸通又數十年，文矩著筆政復為誰耳？抑老松偃蹇，猶存王許故物耶。山陰王易簡 [印]：王理得父、畫隱園

Zhang handed me this tracing, from the stone drums,
Beseeching me to write a poem on the stone drums.
Du Fu has gone. Li Bo is dead.
What can my poor talent do for the stone drums?
…When the Zhou power waned and China was bubbling,
Emperor Xuan, up in wrath, waved his holy spear
And opened his Great Audience, receiving all the tributes
Of kings and lords who came to him with a tune of clanging weapons.
They held a hunt in Qiyang and proved their marksmanship:
Fallen birds and animals were strewn three thousand miles.
And the exploit was recorded, to inform new generations…
Cut out of jutting cliffs, these drums made of stone –
On which poets and artisans, all of the first order,
Had indited and chiseled – were set into the deep mountains
To be washed by rain, baked by sun, burned by wildfire,
Eyed by evil spirits, and protected by the gods.
…Where can he have found the tracing on this paper? –
True to the original, not altered by a hair,
The meaning deep, the phrases cryptic, difficult to read,
And the style of the characters neither square nor tadpole.
Time has not yet vanquished the beauty of these letters –
Looking like sharp daggers that pierce live crocodiles,
Like phoenix–mates dancing, like angels hovering down,
Like trees of jade and coral with interlocking branches,
Like golden cord and iron chain tied together tight,
Like incense-tripods flung in the sea, like dragons mounting heaven.
Historians, gathering ancient poems, forgot to gather these,
To make the two Books of Musical Song more colorful and striking;
Confucius journeyed in the west, but not to the Qin Kingdom,
He chose our planet and our stars but missed the sun and moon…
I who am fond of antiquity, was born too late
And, thinking of these wonderful things, cannot hold back my tears…
I remember, when I was awarded my highest degree,
During the first year of Yuanhe,
How a friend of mine, then at the western camp,
Offered to assist me in removing these old relics.
I bathed and changed, then made my plea to the college president
And urged on him the rareness of these most precious things.
They could be wrapped in rugs, be packed and sent in boxes
And carried on only a few camels: ten stone drums
To grace the Imperial Temple like the Incense-Pot of Gao –
Or their lustre and their value would increase a hundredfold,
If the monarch would present them to the university,
Where students could study them and doubtless decipher them,
And multitudes, attracted to the capital of culture
From all corners of the Empire, would be quick to gather.
We could scour the moss, pick out the dirt, restore the original surface,
And lodge them in a fitting and secure place for ever,
Covered by a massive building with wide eaves
Where nothing more might happen to them as it had before.
…But government officials grow fixed in their ways
And never will initiate beyond precedent;
So herd-boys strike the drums for fire, cows polish horns on them,
With no one to handle them reverentially.
Still aging and decaying, soon they may be effaced.
Six years I have sighed for them, chanting toward the west...
The familiar script of Wang Xizhi, beautiful though it was,
Could be had, several pages, for a few white geese!
But not, eight dynasties after the Zhou, and all the wars over,
Why should there be nobody caring for these drums?
The empire is at peace, the government free.
Poets again are honored and Confucians and Mencians…
Oh, how may this petition be carried to the throne?
It needs indeed an eloquent flow, like a cataract –
But, alas, my voice has broken, in my song of the stone drums,
To a sound of supplication choked with its own tears.[1]

To the right is “Song of the Stone Drums” composed by Changli [Han Yu, 768–824] of the Tang dynasty. Written by Kunxuemin, Xianyu Shu, Boji from Yuyang [present-day Jixian, Hebei] in the summer, the twentieth of the sixth lunar month, of the xinchou year in the Dade reign era [July 26, 1301].

張生手持石鼓文，勸我試作石鼓歌。
少陵無人謫仙死，才薄將奈石鼓何。
周綱陵遲四海沸，宣王憤起揮天戈。
大開明堂受朝賀，諸侯劒珮鳴相磨。
蒐于岐陽騁雄俊，萬里禽獸皆庶羅。
鐫功勒成告萬世，鑿石作鼓隳嵯峨。
從臣才藝咸第一，簡選撰刻留山阿。
雨淋日炙野火燎，鬼物守護煩撝訶。
公從何處得帋本，毫髮盡備無差訛。
辭嚴意密讀難曉，字體不類隸與科[蝌]。
年深豈免有缺畫，快劒斫斷生蛟鼉。
鸞翔鳳翥眾仙下，珊瑚碧樹交枝柯。
金繩鐵索鎖紐壯，古鼎躍水龍騰梭。
陋儒編詩不收入，二雅褊迫無委蛇。
孔子西行不到秦，掎摭星宿遺羲娥。
嗟余好古生苦晚，對此涕泪雙滂沱。
憶昔初蒙博士徵，其年始改稱元和。
故人從軍在右輔，為我量度[度量]掘臼科。
濯冠沐浴告祭酒，如此至寶存豈多。
氈包席裹可立致，十鼓只載數駱駝。
薦諸太廟比郜鼎，光價豈止百倍過。
聖恩若許留太學，諸生講解得切磋。
觀經鴻都尚嗔咽，坐見擧國來奔波。
剜苔剔蘚露節角，安置妥帖平不頗。
大廈深巖[點去]與蓋覆，經歷久遠期無它[佗]。
中朝大官老於事，詎肯感激徒媕婀。
牧童敲火牛礪角，誰復著手為摩挲。
日銷月爍就埋沒，六年西顧空吟哦。
羲之俗書趁姿媚，數帋尚可愽白鹅。
繼周八代爭戰罷，無人收拾理則那。
方今太平日無事，柄用儒術崇丘軻。
安能以此尚論列，願借辯口如懸河。
石鼓之歌止於此，嗚呼吾意其蹉跎。簷

Nie Danian (1402–1456) of Linchuan comments on the calligraphy of Kunxue Laoren [Xianyu Shu] stating: “Calligraphy flourished in the Jin period (317–419). In the Tang dynasty, with the rise of Yan [Zhenqing, 709–785] and Liu [Gongquan, 778–865], the methods and criteria of the old tradition gradually deteriorated. When the style of Su [Shi, 1037–1101] and Mi [Fu, 1052–1107] appeared in the Song dynasty, the tradition of the Wei and Jin periods was then completely discarded. Xianyu Boji [Xianyu Shu] studied calligraphy together with Zhao Wenmin [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322]. But there are qualities in his cursive script that surpass Zhao Mengfu.” Chen Jingzong (1377–1459), the academician, once remarked that [Xianyu Shu’s calligraphy] has definitely entered the gate of the Wang [Xizhi school]. So highly was he regarded by his contemporaries. In short, if one considers the masters Yan, Liu, Su, and Mi as missionaries of the [calligraphic] cult of Wei-Jin, then Zhao Songxue [Zhao Mengfu] and Xianyu Kunxue [Xianyu Shu] were the most outstanding artists of their times. One therefore should not be biased against one at the expense of the other. The cursive style of this scroll has an aged quality of maturity, in addition to the fact that it transcribes Han Yu’s “Song of the Stone Drums.” It is certainly not in the same order as the artist’s more ordinary works. I first saw the scroll in Jingkou, then again in Suzhou. For years I have tried to acquire it before it finally came into my possession. That was the time when we had a continuous cold rain, and I had to keep the stove fire burning every day so the scroll could be remounted by a famed restorer. This is indeed the kind of life that people call “the tasting out of the tasteless.”[3] On the fifteenth of jiaping [the twelfth lunar month] in the jimao year of the Kangxi reign era [February 3, 1700], at the beginning of spring, Gao Shiqi, Jiangcun, noted this by a rainy window in the Jianjing Zhai Studio at Zhehu.

5. Shen Yinmo 沈尹默 (1882–1971), 10 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1938; 1 seal:

Xianyu Kunxue [Xianyu Shu] died in the renyin year of the Dade reign era [1302]. This scroll was written in the xinchou year [1301] when the artist was forty-five years old. It is therefore a work of great deliberation done in his mature years. Among his works that I have seen, this probably ranks highest among [examples of] his cursive script. Wu Pao An [Wu Kuan, 1435–1504] used to say that “Xianyu Shu’s cursive script was derived from the methods of the standard and semi-cursive scripts. The brush was applied with great care. As a result there is always a particular logic and deportment in each of his dots and strokes which never make his audience feel bored or tired. People these days like to reach out for the attainment of Zhang Xu (ca. 675–ca. 750) and [Huai] Su [ca. 735–ca. 800] before they even know anything about the older masters, Ouyang Xun (557–641) and Yu Shinan (558–638). That is why the structure of their calligraphy is so loose, incoherent, and so torturously long-winded that they end up nothing much more than pieces of blown away thatch of creeping weeds.” This is indeed well said. Xianyu Kunxue studied the cursive script together with Zhao Songxue [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322]. Zhao could not praise him more highly, conceding that his art is unsurpassable. Judging from the present example, Zhao’s modesty was after all no mere lip service. Today, I am able to see this scroll side-by-side with the Liu Zhongshi tie, an authentic work written on a bluish paper by Yan Zhenqing from the collection of the Li family of Gaoyang. In addition, at the end of the scroll is Xianyu Shu’s own colophon written in semi-cursive/standard script which again is as fresh and lofty as in his best. It is surely one of the best fortunes of my life to be able to enjoy a day such as this amid all the turmoils boiling over everywhere.

趙蒼雲","Artist’s inscription and signature (70 columns in semi-cursive script)

Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao were from Shan County [in present day Zhejiang Province]. Although they came from old Confucian families, they were also interested in medicine and were accustomed to remaining aloof from the world. Thus did they in the fifteenth year of Yongan [sic] [Yongping永平] reign of Han emperor Mingdi (A.D. 72), take up hoe and basket and set off for the Tiantai Mountains to gather herbs.

Entering the deep mountains, they filled their baskets with herbs. After a short rest they started back, but lost their way. Their food exhausted, the two men looked at one another and were filled with fear and despair. Suddenly they saw a peach tree growing from the mountainside, heavy with ripening fruit. The men clambered up the mountain and picked the fruit—each man eating two peaches—after which their strength returned.

Peaches in their hands, they descended the mountain, seeking the way back. The winding path was rugged and difficult to make out. Eventually they found themselves t the foot of the mountain, and there they saw a clear, cold stream flowing through a ravine. Rinsing their hands, the men scooped up the water and took a drink. Suddenly they saw rutabagas flowing down the mountain stream, followed by a cup filled with sesame rice. The two men looked at one another and exclaimed: “There must be a house nearby.”

The air about the mountains is dense,
The green peaks, lofty and contorted.
Gazing at them you are transported
To another world.

So they lifted up their baskets of herbs and waded into the stream. Because the water was nearly four feet deep, they lifted their robes in order to cross. After a third of a mile they found a small path, which led across a mountain to another stream.

The large stream at the foot of the mountain.

On the opposite side of the stream they saw two women whose marvelous beauty was of another world. The two women waved, calling Liu and Ruan by name as if they were old friends. When the two men crossed the stream the women giggled and said: “How late you are!” Their voices were dulcet, their fragrance alluring, as they spoke to the men and took them by the hand. Although they were [to the men] as brides, they behaved as if they had known them for many years. At first the two men suspected they might be witches, but gradually they lost their fear and regarded them as human.

The two women invited the men to accompany them home, leading them along a winding mountain paths through hills covered with blossoming peach trees. After about a mile they reached their residence, which was decorated in an extravagant manner beyond the likes of any mortal dwelling. To either side were serving women in light blue clothing, their manner sober and dignified, their appearance elegant and radiant as clouds. After a brief rest the women prepared a delicious meal of sesame rice and mountain goat, after which the men were no longer hungry. They inquired about the women’s families, but the ladies only laughed and made small talk, refusing to reveal anything. The two men eventually stopped asking. They realized these were strange women. And they observed that there were no men in the house.

In the courtyard a banquet was arranged, with wine and food set out to wish the men long life. After a few cups [of wine] guest immortals arrived at the ladies’ residence bringing peaches of longevity and announcing, “We have come to congratulate the grooms.” The two men paid their respects to the immortals, each of whom wore magical clothes and carried the musical instrument which they played in perfect harmony. For two or three hours the two men drank happily, while the two female immortals personally served them cups [of wine] and urged them to drink more. The beguiling melodies evoked an almost tangible sensation of spring, and the two men felt they were in paradise. The guests departed as the sun set.

The two women persuaded Liu and Ruan to remain for more than half a month, but then the men asked to return home. The women responded, “Coming upon us and living here is your good fortune. How can the herbal elixirs of the common world compare to this immortal dwelling?” So they begged the men to stay for half a year. Every day was like late spring, but the mournful cries of the mountain birds caused the two men to plead even more to return home. The women said, “Traces of your Karma have remained here, which is why you still feel this way.” So they summoned the other female immortals to bid them farewell with music, saying, “Not far from the mouth of this cave is a roadway leading to your home. It’s easy.”

The two men exited the cave and reached the roadway. They looked back but saw only the brilliant glow of peach blossoms and the layered greens of the mountain. When they arrived home, they recognized no one. Greatly perplexed, they made inquiries until they realized that [the villagers] were their seventh-generation descendants.

Finding that their homeland held neither close relations nor a place to live, the two men decided to reenter the Tiantai Mountains and seek out the roadway that they had just followed. But they way was obscured, and they became lost. Later, in the eighth year of the Taikang reign era of Jin Wudi (A.D. 287), the two again entered the Tiantai Mountains. What became of them remains unknown.

Painted and inscribed by Cangyun Shanren (Zhao Cangyun).[1]

劉晨、阮肇，剡縣人也，家世業儒，尤留意於醫，嘗飄然有霞表之氣味。漢明
帝永安十五年，二人攜鋤筥，往天台山採藥焉！

入山既深，尋藥方盈筥，少憩將返，迷失來路，且糧糗俱盡，二人相顧，方狼
狽失措。偶舉目見山頭有桃木樛然，桃實纍然。二人往山上取桃食之，人各食二
枚，如覺少健然。

食桃尤在手，下山求歸。路轉轉崎嶇，益難辨識。行次不覺至山麓，見澗中水流
潺然，清泠可可。二人以手挹水飲之，且各澡其手面。偶見蔓菁從山腹出，次
又有一杯流出，中有胡麻飯屑。二人相顧曰: “去人家不遠矣。”

巒氣滃鬱，山色螺聳。望中恍然，如接異境。

因負藥筥，以鋤挺探水，水纔四尺許，二人褰裳渡之。行及一里餘，得小徑，
又度一山，又見一溪焉。

山麓處大溪。

隔溪見二女顏色絕妙，世所未有，便揮手喚劉、阮姓名，似有舊交。二人渡溪，
二女喜笑而語，曰:“郎來何晚也！”意味和懌，香氣襲人，相語相攜，雖
合卺之協情，經數載未有如此之婉好也。二人始疑為媚，久之方辨識為人，而亦
不之懼焉。

二女因邀歸家，所過山徑崎嶇，滿山桃花爛然。行及三里餘，到其所居。廳館
朴廠，服飾非如人間所有。左右女侍息青衣，皆端正莊靚，爛然如雲。少憩，
煮胡麻飯、山羊脯，食之甘美。二人食方畢，不覺饑，欲訊家世，二女但相與
談笑亂之，略不之告，二人亦不敢固問，知其為異人。久之，亦不見其家有男
子也。

既而又當庭設席，陳酒肴為二人壽。方飛觴次，有數仙客持三、五仙桃至女
家，云來慶女婿，各至席。二人禮之，數仙客皆仙服，各出樂器奏之，肅
雝和鳴。暢飲逾二、三時候，二女親各舉巵勸二人酒。款曲之情，春氣可挹，
二子恍然如在天上也。日向暮，仙客各還去。

二女邀劉、阮偕止宿，約半月餘，二子求還。女答曰: “今來此，皆汝宿福所招
得。至予仙館，比之流俗，有此樂否?”遂懇留住及半年。天氣常如三春，山鳥
哀鳴，二子求歸甚切。女曰: “業根未滅，使令子心如此。”於是喚諸仙女，共
作鼓吹送劉、阮歸，遂告之曰: “從此山洞口出去不遠，至大道至家易矣。”

二人出洞口，行至大道，回首惟桃花燦爛，山色堆青而已。甫至家鄉，並無
相識，鄉里怪異，乃聞得七代子孫，傳上祖入山不出，不知今何在。

二子在鄉既無親屬，棲泊無所，卻同入天台山，尋當年所往。山路已迷，而
不知所在。後至晉武帝太康八年，二子復入天台，不知其所之也。

1. Hua Youwu 華幼武 (1307-after 1386), 10 columns in standard script, dated 1379:

High-minded and eccentric and fond of drinking, Cangyun Shanren was a member of
the Song imperial clan. His paintings often attained the divine class. His landscapes, mostly in the boneless ink-wash style, are boldly conceived and filled with vitality. His delicate figure paintings possess a distinctive character rare to behold. This painting, Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao Entering the Tiantai Mountains, is free and unfettered, relaxed and elegant. Its draperies of Cao [Zhongda仲達, active ca. 550-77] and scarves of Wu [Daozi道子, active ca. 710-60] and its marvelous tonalities are unattainable by most artists. I think the story of Liu and Ruan may not be entirely without basis. Tang authors have observed that female immortals belong also to the demon world. And he who acquires this ink masterpiece may indeed believe that Spiritual Mountain and Western Garden still exist. Unrolling this scroll, I felt I was amid clouds of peach blossoms and waves of willow, cooled by a breeze and warmed by the sun. In his youth Cangyun was more famous than [his fellow clansmen] Ziang (Zhao Mengfu趙孟頫, 1254-1322) and Zigu (Zhao Mengjian趙孟堅, 1199-before 1267), but because he never married and never served as an official, but withdrew to live as a recluse amid the mountain forests and lakes, his presence was elusive. So when one of his paintings was acquired, it was considered precious as jade. He was a man of remarkable ingenuity but one who also suffered; alas, there can never by another like him.

In autumn, the ninth month, of the twelfth year of the Hongwu reign (1379), Hua Youwu wrote this in the Chuncao Xuan Studio.

蒼雲山人本趙宋宗室，高奇嗜酒，繪事入神。山水橫放，大都倣沒骨圖，而生動過之。人物工緻，別有姿韻，世不多見。所作《劉阮天台圖》意境蕭散，神趣閒逸。曹衣吳带，設色妍玅，有諸家所不能及者。竊意劉、阮未必非烏有子虛，唐人云僊姝亦屬魅界。但得此墨妙，覺靈山儼然，西園猶在，展卷不知身在桃雲柳浪清風紅日間也。蒼雲早歲名在子昂、子固上，不婚不宦，每隱於山林湖舫，雖親串無從蹤跡，世人得其片幀，幾如拱璧。此其匠心運意備極慘澹，當不能有二也。洪武十二年秋九月華幼武書於春草軒。

2. Yao Guangxiao 姚廣孝 (1335-1418), 7 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1386:

In the second month of spring in the bingyin [year, 1386], I was feeling bored and so took a boat with Hua Qibi (Hua Youwu) and sailed about the lakes for a full month. Hua’s conversation and poetry were eloquent, his eyes were keen. He was very knowledgeable and loved antiques and had a large collection of stele calligraphies. Contentedly we passed the time, discussing and evaluating [works of art] and sharing interests beyond the ordinary. From time to time we would view Zhao Cangyun’s “Princely Grandsons in the Taintai [Mountains],” admiring the animation and emotion of his figures and scenery and delighting at his conception as we rolled and unrolled the scroll. It is a painting that has attained the three perfections. Qibi had already added a colophon, and so I added mine. I have been a traveler for a long time; these days I am almost never able to quit this wandering. Do I live in this painting?

Recorded by Daoyan (Yao Guangxiao).

丙寅春仲無憀中鼓枻過華棲碧湖上，留連匝月，談詠甚適，耳目洞爽。華君沉博嗜古，所藏碑版甚夥。商確評品，彼此恍然，盡得象外物表之趣。偶示趙蒼雲王孫《天台圖》，人物景色飛動有情，宛轉離合，極快意事，作懌懌之狀，是入繪中三昧者。棲碧有題，予踵其後。予久作東西南北人，他年一會儼然未散，其在斯乎？道衍識。

3. Song Yong 宋邕 (unidentified), 13 columns in semi-cursive script, undated:

“Liu and Ruan Encounter Immortals in a Cave”

The sky merges with the verdant color of the trees,
Layered clouds and mountain mists obscure the road.
Rising vapors envelop the mountains; the birds are silent.
The murmur of the valley stream is like the music of pipes and reeds.
In the green cave, there is no gulf between heaven and earth,
The red branches of the trees are as long lived as the sun and the moon.
If only people would appear among the flowers,
Instead of the wailings of the immortals beckoning Liu

“The Immortals Escort Liu and Ruan Out of the Cave”

Solicitously they are escorted from the Tiantai Mountains.
How can the immortals’ paradise be regained?
Drink of the cloud’s nectar before going home,
The jade scriptures cannot be opened at will.
Flowers at the mouth of the cave will blossom forever,
But water that flows out from this other world,
As the bright moon shines on the jade-green mountains illuminating the verdant moss.

[Signed] Song Yong

劉、阮洞中遇仙人

天和樹色靄蒼蒼，霞重嵐深路渺茫。
雲竇滿山無鳥雀，水聲沿澗有笙簧。
碧沙洞裡乾坤別，紅樹枝邊日月長。
願得花間有人出，免令仙犬吠劉郎。

仙人送劉、阮出洞

殷勤相送出天台，仙境那能卻再來。
雲液既歸須強飲，玉書無事莫頻開。
花當洞口應長在，水到人間定不迴。
惆悵溪頭從此別，碧山明月照蒼苔。

The sunny gorges hum with increasing waves.
Perching hundreds of feet high, the pavilions appear spacious.
How would it feel to lean on a railing and enjoy this view?

Mi Yuanhui’s (Mi Youren) painting is very much like the calligraphy of the two Wangs [Wang Xizhi王羲之, 303‒361, and Wang Xianzhi王獻之, 344‒385], in which the characters have exemplary forms but appear spontaneous. Running into a scenic site of villages in cloudy mountains on his trip, he picked up the brush to make a painting and presented it to the emperor, who then bestowed it to a contemporary scholar of the Erying Ge Pavilion [in the palace]. Now it is in my collection. Ah! All those people have passed away, though the painting still remains. I will treasure it with respect to ensure its transmission to future generations. On the Chufu Day [in mid-July] of the gengshen year in the Qingyuan reign (1200), Mo’an, Shengyu (Wang Jie) from Langya [in Shandong Province] made the note.[1]

米元暉畫大似二王書，字有典形而無拘礙。偶道中逢村墅雲山之勝，就筆染紙，歸以獻宸扆，旋復賜當代邇英，今歸予几格。嗚呼！人俱非矣，物仍存焉。敬當寳惜以傳無窮。慶元庚申初伏日琅邪默庵聖與誌。

2. Xianyu Shu 鮮于樞 (1257‒1302), 11 columns in running-cursive script, dated 1290; 4 seals:

Poetry critics say that if one has ten ideas but puts into words only three, one may then compare with the Li sao and the Odes. I think the same is true with painting. An artisan's painting is short in ideas but good at capturing formal likeness, which is opposite to the works of lofty and superior scholars. The paintings by the two Mis are of the latter kind. In this piece of paper, if one speaks of clear delineation then anyone can do it. But in the representation of trees and sloping banks, the color of the grass echoes that of the earth, and the ideas embedded in the stretch of river shore lie beyond the actual brushwork, which no one can match.[2] In the summer, the fifth day of the sixth month, of the gengyin year in the Zhiyuan reign (July 12, 1290), the Retired Official in Hangzhou (Xianyu Shu) wrote this in his Kunxue Zhai Studio.

Colophons[1]

1. Gao Gu 高榖 (1391–1460), 23 columns in standard script, dated 1447; 3 seals:

Cloudy Mountains was made by the lofty Daoist monk of the Shangqing [Temple], Fang Fanghu [Fang Congyi]. Connoisseurs collected it because they believed it to be a precious object. Judging from the dexterity of the brushwork and the depth of the conception, clearly [Fang’s] paintings are of the same standard as those by Mi Nangong [Mi Fu, 1052–1107] and Gao Fangshan [Gao Kegong, 1248–1310]; they must not be compared to later artists who learned only the superficials. In this scroll, the layered peaks are tinted with the colors of a clear day, now hidden, now revealed by the drifting mist and clouds; the long strip of mountain slope looks like a sandy embankment. The gates of the mountain home seem so quiet, as if no one is there. This must be either a choice realm of the immortals, or some supreme view of the mortal world.

In my family there used to be a painting by Fanghu, although its composition, treatment of depth, and proportions cannot possibly rival this scroll, the excellence of the spirit and the nuance in its use of ink are certainly comparable. Alas, ink-wash paintings like those of Fanghu are not to be frequently seen, even though his paintings have circulated in the world for only seventy-some years. This cannot help but redouble one’s feeling of admiration [for this work]. So I write a quatrain to commemorate this event:

The guest from Yingzhou cannot be seen;
His soundless poems give profound pleasure.
Intermittent clouds obscure the rustic cottage;
Distant trees girdle the mountain slopes.
Traces of the hermit are not to be found;
The woodcutter has finished his song.
Unrolling the painting, I imagine his loftiness,
How truly I long to be [in this place].

Composed on the thirteenth day of the intercalary fourth lunar month in the summer of the dingmao year, the twelfth year of the Zhengtong era [May 27, 1447], by Right Assistant Minister of Works [of the secondary capital], Academician Expositor-in-waiting in the Hanlin Academy [of the secondary capital] and Official of the Classics Colloquium, Gao Gu of Huainan [in Jiangsu Province][2] [Seals]: Weiyang, Shiyong, Yu Zhai

《雲山圖》 一幅，上清高士方方壺所作也，好事者藏之，以為珍玩。觀其筆法精到，意態悠遠，與米南宮、高房山同一軌度，非後來淺之為學者之比。然而晴嵐疊嶂掩映於煙雲縹緲之際，山坡一帶，長若隄築，巖扉幽邃，闃然無人，蓋仙家之勝境、塵坱之絕觀也。予家有方壺手跡一披，其布置遠近大小，雖不敢差肩於斯，而精神點染之妙，殆不可以優劣論。鳴呼！水墨之筆如方壺者不復多見矣，其流落人間，距今餘七十載，不能不使人重其景仰之思，因為五言律一，以紀其事云：
不見瀛洲客[點去]，無聲意趣多。
斷雲迷野墅，遠樹帶山坡。
木客深潛跡，樵人已罷歌。

2. Zhou Kai 周凱 (active early 15th c.), 13 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 3 seals:

The lofty scholar of the Shangqing Temple, Fang Fanghu,
In what year did he paint this Cloudy Mountains?
How can his creativity be bound by common feelings?
This realm is far removed from the mortal world.
From Langfeng the path winds to the isle of Peng [-lai],
The ethereal vapors lead to Daxiabiao.
Rare grasses are fragrant, daylight lingers,
Ripened peaches confer youthfulness.
Towering palaces silhouetted against the azure sky,
White clouds and blue mists making an expansive haze.
As if seeing the shine of cinnabar within the caves,
Or hearing the chirping of orioles in the trees.
Guangcheng and An Qi, where are they?
Facing this painting increases my admiration [for Fang].
When will he return riding the wind
To relieve this dusty world of its deep ailments?
Zhou Kai from Yongjia [in Zhejiang Province]. [Seals]: Ouyue, Zhou shi Zhonglü, Yu zaowu you

上清高士方方壺，何年畫此雲山圖。
玄機豈為俗情繫，異境自與塵寰殊。
閬風逶迤接蓬島，弱水東連大霞表。
瑤草香生白日遲，蟠桃實熟青春好。
臺殿巍峨紫翠分，白雲蒼靄交氤氳。
丹光仿佛洞中見，鶯語依稀樹裏聞。
廣成安期在何處，對此令人益傾慕。

3. Gu Han 顧翰 (early 15th c.), 9 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 3 seals:

The mountains green,
The waters vast.
Unrolling the painting feels like in the [region of the] Xiao and Xiang [Rivers].
It’s been more than twenty years since I was there.
I hear the singing of the fishermen, the rain falling in the trees.
Now seeing this painting is like being in a dream;
Suddenly, I recall this land of seagulls and egrets.
When will I cast off these worldly cares?
Carrying the wine, I’ll go back again to row a boat and enjoy my leisure.

4. Wang Qian 王謙 (mid-15th c.), 6 columns in standard script, undated; 3 seals:

One shower in the mountains does away with dusty air;
A thousand cliffs and myriad ravines are half-hidden by clouds.
Rocks conceal the clear water of the flowing brook;
The path traversing the woods is obscure and hard to follow.
In high and low abodes the immortals dwell;
In various fields rest groups of cranes.
Someday, I will move my home to this place.
In spring, I will plow the land along the dikes.

5. Shen Chengzhang 沈成章 (mid-15th c.), 7 columns in semi-cursive/standard script, undated; 3 seals:

There is a lofty person who possesses the Way, whose sobriquet is Fanghu.
In his heart there is no trace of worldliness.
His brush, imbued with clouds and mist, seizes the force of Creation,
Like a whip that drives dragons and tigers.
Evoking the realm of vast ocean and continents,
The painting resembles Ten thousand miles along the Yangtze River.
The Yang family should treasure this scroll in its collection generation after generation.
After viewing and enjoying it, I write down my advice in an inscription.
Shen Chengzhang of Wujun [Suzhou, Jiangsu] [Seals]: Xuan Zhai, Da Ming jinshi, Chengzhang

This secluded spot is no common place --
A Penglai realm on a foot-wide [picture] surface.
The huts in the deep woods are tranquil and quiet;
The flowing waters beneath the wilderness bridge are free.
The birds fly away into the distant sky;
Clouds drift among the mountains.
In this place traces of men are rare;
Along the pine-covered path light rain spots the moss.
Qian Bo of Yunjian [in Jiangsu Province] [Seals]: Quan shi yanxia, Yunxin songyi

7. Zhan Jingfeng 詹景鳳 (1528–1602), 17 columns in standard script, dated 1597; 3 seals:

Former scholars titled this scroll by Fang Fanghu “Mountains of the Immortals.” They truly are mountains of the immortals. Although I have seen many paintings by Fanghu, I have never seen a work carefully done, but this scroll is carefully done in particular. Works ion color are rare, but this handscroll is painted with translucent red wash. Being subtle, it is surpassingly excellent. Vaporous and indistinct, it is not concerned with formal likeness. The painting has color but the color is diffuse; it cannot be described in terms of color. The conception is misty and inexhaustible; in its mood, free and subliminal, there is profound feeling. Therefore, the conception is still more difficult to match. If the painter were not an enlightened person like Fanghu, he could not attain this. Now I know that those paintings by Fanghu that are often seen and appear coarse are not painted with care. This scroll and the painting of Mount Shu in my collection are both carefully executed. Together they should be treasured as a pair of rare and eternal jade disks. Composed on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month of the dingyou year in the Wanli era [October 19, 1597] by Zhan Jingfeng, Dongtu fu. [Seals]: Zhan Jingfeng yin, Dongtu fu, Dong xi nan bei zhi ren

8. Wu Hufan 吳湖帆 (1894–1968), 6 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1949; 1 seal:

Fanghu’s brushwork often appears wild with little restraint. Although his fame was high like divine peaks and jade forests, he could not avoid this [fault]. His brushwork in this scroll conveys substantiality. It captures the spirit of Songxue [Zhao Mengfu, 1254–1322] and evokes the paintings of Shuming [Wang Meng, ca. 1308–1385], and therefore is superior to Zhao Yuan [active ca. 1350–1375] and the likes. In the winter of the wuzi year [1948], my young colleague [Wang] Jiqian [1907–2003] returned from Beijing and brought this [scroll] back. Its return is worth a celebration. In spring, the first month of the jichou year [1949], Wu Hufan recorded this after borrowing it for viewing for some ten days.[3] [Seal]: Qian An

2. 6 columns in semi-cursive script, undated:

Ever since my youth, after practicing calligraphy, I have toyed with some small paintings, but landscape is one subject that I have not been able to master. This is because I have not managed to see even one or two masterpieces by Wang Wei (701–761), the senior and junior general Li [i.e. Li Sixun (active 705–720) and Li Zhaodao (active mid-8th c.)], and Zheng Qian (active mid-8th c.) of the Tang period. As for works of the Five Dynasties masters, such as Jing Hao (active ca. 870–930), Guan Tong (active ca. 907–923), Dong Yuan (active 930s–960s), and Fan Kuan (ca. 960–ca. 1030), who succeeded one another [as leading masters], the “brush idea” [biyi] of all of them is absolutely different from the style of recent paintings. As for my own work, I dare not compare it with those of the ancient masters, but when I look at what recent painters have done, I daresay mine is a bit different. Since [Dong] Yeyun asked for a painting, I wrote this at the end, Mengfu.[1]

僕自幼小學書之餘，時時戲弄小筆，然扵山水獨不能工。蓋自唐以來，如王右丞、大小李將軍、鄭廣文諸公奇絕之跡，不能一二見。至五代荊關董范輩出，皆與近世筆意遼絕。僕所作者，雖未敢與古人比，然視近世畫手，則自謂少異耳。因野雲求畫，故書其末。孟頫

But for many years now I have lived away in the capital.

As I enjoy perusing this painting.

The Twin Pines, Pure and Distant scroll, painted and inscribed with a colophon by the respectable Zhao Wenmin [Zhao Mengfu] of Wuxing [in Zhekiang], has been acquired by Academician Suxuan [Qian Ning, died ca. 1522], who appreciates it profoundly. Suxuan’s character and family background compare closely with Wenmin’s, so, respecting the man, he loves his painting. In the precious Yuan dynasty, Wenmin attained the position of Recipient of Edicts in the Hanlin Academy through his literary accomplishment. At the time, scholars and officials admired his superiority in a dozen things; his talents were certainly not limited to painting and calligraphy. However, as a descendant of the imperial family of the past Song dynasty, he served the Yuan ruler. I suspect that his fellow scholar-officials’ opinions of him resonated with the message of the poem “Reaching Old Age with the Husband” in the Odes of Yong. I wonder how Ban Gu (32–92) and Sima Qian (ca. 145–ca. 86 B.C.) would think of him. Inscribed by Tong Xuan of Poyang [in Jiangxi], Assistant Surveillance Commissioner of Yunnan.

1. Yongxing 永瑆 (1752–1823), 6 columns in standard script, dated 1816:

Qian Weishan (active mid-14th c.) included in his personal anthology, Jiangyue songfeng ji, a poem inscribed on Ascending Dragon painted by Celestial Master Guangwei [Zhang Yucai], which reads:
Breathing the air, riding the clouds, it reaches to the sky.
The ink master works magic; his inkstone smacks of aquatic creatures.
The waves shine, as the pair of swords submerge;
The storm darkens, as the six goddesses [of thunder and lightening] are dispatched.
Flames of fire dart skywards;
Green scales dive in, raising turbulence in the vast sea.
The man of perfect cultivation, carried up along the way, turns immortal;
How can I cling to [the dragon’s] whiskers to cross the Dongting [Lake]?
Recorded by Prince Cheng [Yongxing] on the fifth of the second lunar month in the bingzi year of the Jiaqing reign era [March 3, 1816].

錢惟善 《江月松風集》 有〈題廣微天師昇龍圖詩〉曰：
“噓氣乘雲薄太清,墨卿靈怪硯池腥。
波濤光彩失雙劍，風雨晦冥驅六丁。
朱火騰空超碧落，翠鱗垂水捲滄溟。
真人上挾飛仙去，安得攀髯過洞庭。”
嘉慶丙子二月五日成親王錄。

宋高宗","Inscriptions on the painting

Attributed to Song emperor Gaozong 宋高宗 (r. 1127–62), 31 columns in semi-cursive script, undated:

及宋，宋襄公贈之以馬二十乘。

及鄭，鄭文公亦不禮焉。叔詹諫曰：“臣聞天之所啟，人弗及也。晉公子有三焉，天其或者將建諸，君其禮焉。男女同姓，其生不蕃。晉公子，姬出也，而至於今，一也。離外之患，而天不靖晉國，殆將啟之，二也。有三士足以上人而從之，三也。晉、鄭同儕，其過子弟固將禮焉，況天之所啟乎。”弗聼。

及楚，楚子饗之，曰：“公子若反晉國，則何以報不榖？”對曰：“子女玉帛，則君有之；羽毛齒革，則君地生焉。其波及晉國者，君之餘也，其何以報君？”曰：“雖然，何以報我？”對曰：“若以君之靈，得反晉國，晉、楚治兵，遇於中原，其辟君三舍。若不獲命，其左執鞭弭，右屬橐鞬，以與君周旋。”子玉請殺之。楚子曰：“晉公子廣而儉，文而有禮，其從者肅而寬，忠而能力。晉侯無親，外內惡之。吾聞姬姓唐叔之後，其後衰者也。其將由晉公子乎？天將興之，誰能廢之？違天必有大咎。”乃送諸秦。

秦伯納女五人，懷嬴與焉。奉匜沃盥，既而揮之。怒曰：“秦、晉匹也，何以卑我！”公子懼，降服而囚。他日，公享之。子犯曰：“吾不如衰之文也，請使衰從。”公子賦 《河水》，公賦 《六月》。趙衰曰：“重耳拜賜。”公子降拜稽首，公降一級而辭焉。衰曰：“君稱所以佐天子者命重耳，重耳敢不拜？”

及河，子犯以璧授公子，曰：“臣負羈絏，從君巡於天下，臣之罪甚多矣。臣猶知之，而況君乎？請由此亡。”公子曰：“所不與舅氏同心者，有如白水。”投其璧于河。

濟河，圍令狐，入桑泉，取臼衰。二月甲午晉師軍于廬柳，秦伯使公子縶如晉師，師退軍于郇。辛丑狐偃及秦，晉之大夫盟於郇。壬寅公子入于晉師，丙午入于曲沃，丁未朝於武宮。","Label strip

Colophons

1. Qiao Kuicheng 喬簀成 (13th–14th c.), 12 columns in standard script, undated; 2 seals:

右圖晉文公復國故實，間書《左氏傳》於左。始于宋襄贈馬，至朝於武宮而止。前輩跋謂為吳元瑜畫，黃魯直書。余諦觀筆法，圖乃李唐，書乃思陵，不可誣也。且余家向藏 《晉公子復國圖》 一巻，為晞古妙筆。前有奔狄、過衛、適齊、及曹四事。其後布景則同，而無書。此則逸其前，而書《左傳》於後。蓋思陵少年書學魯直，後劉豫令能書者為間，遂改學六朝人法，自成一家，無怪乎後人之誤評耳。余乃削其跋，正其名，而著語于後，世必有韙余言者。北燕喬簀成識。 [印]： 中山父印、喬簣成印

2. Shi Yan 石巗 (14th c.), 16 columns in clerical script, dated 1334; 3 seals:

李唐，字晞古，河陽人。在宣、靖間已著名畫院。南渡後，流寓臨安，賣畫自給，無有識者，途窮日困。嘗作詩曰：“雪裡煙村雨裡灘，看之容易作之難。早知不入時人眼，多買臙脂畫牡丹。”可概見矣。後有中使識之，奏聞，復入待詔，一變前學，遂為畫院之首。此圖前後有“宣和”大、小璽，後人便目為北宋，而不知為晞古早年之筆，高古迺爾，尤足珍也。至於高宗書傳，亦與晚年書法不同，想初駐臨安時，流離播遷，冀圖復國，如登天上。見此圖有不驚心感嘆者乎。節書《左傳》，有以夫仲山訂正而改題，洵有據哉。元統二年秋八月既望石巗題，是日弁陽周公謹同觀。 [印]： 墨池清興、石氏書印、平臺

3. Wu Kuan 吳寬 (1435–1504), 13 columns in standard script, dated 1470; 1 seal:

宋高宗萬機之暇喜書經文，嘗曰：“寫字當寫經書，不惟學字，又得經書不忘。”曾寫有 《十三經》，刻石禁中。迨元初，楊璉真珈發宋諸陵造塔，取故經石為塔址，遂散落如雲煙矣。予所見真跡惟 《毛詩》頗多，毎十篇作一卷，虛其左，令馬和之補圖，大抵乃德壽宮事。此巻則李畫在前，人物類伯時，樹石、宮宇肖黃筌，較勝晚年之作。而書在後者，益證為思陵早年筆，有虞永興風規，足稱二絕。成化六年四月望日吳寬題。 [印]： 原博

The plum paintings by the Stone-cooking Mountain Peasant [Wang Mian] are in no way inferior to those by Yang Wujiu [Yang Buzhi, 1097–1169]. His brushwork is free with an ancient flair, powerful yet eccentric, which was unique of his time. One can envision his lofty spirit and wild manners while wielding a wooden sword in a tall, brimmed hat and a pair of thick-soled wooden clogs. Unfortunately he was not prolific; very few of his works have survived. I have only seen a long handscroll by him at the Lanyun Ge Studio.

No wheel ruts pit the road in the spring.
I’ve sown my seeds, and I am content, leading the life of a recluse,
Leaning on my cane, watching my children and grandchildren.

Written by Song Zhongwen (Song Ke).[1]

負郭堂成水竹列，平生筆硯是鋤犁。
性田願喜無溝洫，心地何曾有町畦。
秋日稻粱喧鳥雀，春風門巷絕軫蹄。
近來種得青雲滿，飽看兒孫獨杖藜。

Yesterday’s wind arose from the west-north,
And innumerable boats all took advantage of its favor.
Today’s wind has shifted [and comes from] the east,
And my boat [needs] fifteen men to tow.
Their strength spent, I've hired more;
[But even] one hundred in gold they consider too little.
The boat crew, angered, begins to argue,
So the trackers, sitting down, stare and complain.
They've tried poles and again pulleys;
They have had to swallow the yellow gorge rising in their throats.
But the river mud seems to side with the trackers;
Stuck on the bottom, [the boat] won’t budge.
Paid more money, the men are no longer angry.
Expectations satisfied, all resentment disappears.
With a single pull, [the boat advances] like a wind-born chariot.
The men shout out, as if rushing into battle!
To the side I look toward the Yingdou Lake;
So vast, [seemingly] without bounds are its shores.
If even one drop cannot be drawn,
What use is the distant West River?
All things must find their proper time,
So why is it that you have come so late?[1]

40285,"Poems on painting plum blossoms and bamboo
行書梅竹詩譜",https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/40285,"Zhao Mengjian
趙孟堅","Inscription: Artist’s inscription and signature (68 columns in semi-cursive and cursive scripts)

Kang Jiean of my hometown, a painter of ink plum blossoms, has asked me for a poem, so I will explain what is important and what is unimportant in this art.

Taochan [Yang Wujiu, 1097‒1169] followed the style of Huaguang [Monk Zhongren, ca. 1051‒1123];
He captured the pure resonance of the master.
Xianan [Tang Zhengzhong, ca. mid-late 12th c.] studied with Taochan;
He learned clear composition from his master.
As one looks at the jade-like flowers and mouse-whisker stamens,
One knows his skill is more exquisite [than that of Huaguang].
His branches are always depicted in the shape of deer horns,
The vitality of his painting comes from this kind of execution.
Although it is not important to consider the orthodox tradition,
Compared to the true method [of Yang and Tang] the others are not proper.
Monk Ding paints the flowers skillfully but the branches are roughly done,
Liu Mengliang has good ideas but his technique is insufficient.
Surprisingly there is a lady painter, Madame Bao,
She has been able to inherit her master's method.
It is a pity for me knowing the fame of the fine plum painter
Bi Gongji of Jiangxi but never having met him;
The painting of Yang Jiheng is coarse, distasteful, and clumsy;
He is the first to introduce bad taste but Yao Xuepeng is even worse.
This is like the saying of Zhang Rong:
""I regret that the two Wangs did not have my calligraphy method.""
How many girls who lived near the beautiful Xishi tried to compare with her?
How can something interesting not be transmitted?
One must have the eye to discover beauty.
A flower should be painted with only seven stamens and three sepals;
New buds should be executed with dots like pepper,
The tip of the branch must be painted like a rat's tail.
Light and dark ink are applied
For showing the branches in three layers of ink tones.
Flowers should be depicted with front and back sides
While buds are painted in various shapes.
You already comprehend the secret of this art,
If I repeat this method, my words become verbose.
Whose family will have your painting on a screen?
My poem may be used to explain your art.

Kang Jie’an seemed not to comprehend my poem, but Xu Meigu asked me for another poem on the same subject, so I wrote the following:

Dark ink is used for the blossoming branches,
Light ink is used for the tip of the branches.
The old trunk with scales and wrinkles should be painted
With slightly dark and dry ink.
The flower petals can be depicted with three strokes
Separately drawn but still connected.
Pepper dots used to show the new buds should be drawn like pearls.
Strokes fine as bee whiskers are painted around the heart of the flower
Like a smiling face with a dimple,
The long branch tip is executed with a stroke
Steadily dragged like a rat's tail.
Painting the plum blossoms in the wind,
All the flowers should be moving in the same direction.
Half the branch may be covered with snow
When painting the plum in this guise,
The plum blossoms must be arranged properly
When painted together with pine and bamboo.
When flowers are depicted floating on the water,
Make them seem to dance and toss.
When painting evening scenery, accompany it with the bright moon.
Besides long and short bridges,
Plum blossoms may be arranged along clear shallow mountain streams.
A group of blossoming branches painted close to each other
Seem to have a clamorous and cheerful feeling;
Branches depicted back-to-back quietly
Display a listless expression.
Although the brushwork of a painting is distinctively finished,
It is obviously more than just brushstrokes;
On a scroll, the vertical and horizontal lines are not merely drawing.
[Looking at a painting] one will feel the room
Filling with the atmosphere of springtime,
Or recall passing through plum blossoms in the rain.
From beginning to end, Yang and Tang's methods should be followed;
Continue studying hard; how can skill be mastered in just a day?

I wrote the following for the bamboo painter Wang Cuiyan, who asked for a poem on this subject:

The most ancient paintings showed objects without definite forms,
Then forms were depicted closely following the actual objects.
People later followed the methods of early masters,
Tracing their footprints as though stamping a seal on clay.
But a close copy is like building the same house upon another,
When new ideas are added the work is more satisfying.
It has been several hundred years since the Wei and Jin dynasties.
Who can carry on the calligraphic tradition of Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi?
People nowadays forget the poetry of Li Bai and Du Fu.
They are eager to study the new style of the Jianghu school.
I hope you can plant a thousand acres of bamboo
Like those growing along the Wei River;
After a meal you can relax and take a walk.
All the phenomena of bamboo in wind, in clear weather, in mist and in rain
Will be within your heart,
The luxuriant and upright nature of bamboo
Will come forth freely from your brush.
Oh, how common Zizhang looks when Yuan Dafu appears!

These three poems may be seen as a treatise on plum and bamboo painting. However, those who do not have poetry in their hearts will be confounded when they see these poems. Several months after Cuiyan received my poem, he suddenly came to ask me: ""What I requested was a poem on bamboo painting, why did you write about the poems of Li Bai and Du Fu?"" I answered with a laugh, ""This is not beyond your understanding. It's only that no one has ever told you about it. Have you not heard the words: ""If you restrict your theme, you can not be a good poet'?"" My cousin Huangfu, who has been studying here with me, learned that I had composed these poems, and he delightedly asked me to write them down. I worry that I too may not have a poetic nature and will also be confounded. Those who understand poetry may correct me. I am old now and do not wish to say too much.

Written by Zhao Mengjian, Zigu, Yizhai Jushi of the royal family under the light of a candle at ten o'clock on the sixth day of the tenth month, the first year of the Jingding era [1260]. I am now staying with the Wang family of Salt Bridge [in Hangzhou].[1]

里中康節菴畫墨梅求詩，因述本末以示之。子固

逃禪祖花光, 得其韻度之清麗； 間菴紹逃禪, 得其蕭散之布置。
回觀玉面而鼠鬚，已自工夫較精緻。
枝枝例作鹿角曲，生意由來端若爾。
所傳正統諒末節，捨此的傳皆偽耳。
僧定花工枝則粗，夢良[貴字點去]意到工則未。
女[兒字點去]中卻有鮑夫人，能守師繩不輕墜。
可憐聞名未識面，云有江西畢公濟。
季衡醜粗惡拙祖，弊到雪蓬觴濫矣。
所恨二王無臣法，多少東鄰擬西子。
是中有趣豈不傳，要以眼力求其旨。
踢鬚止七蕚則三，點眼名椒梢鼠尾。
枝分三疊墨濃澹，花有正背多般蘂。
夫君固已悟筌蹄，重說偈言吾亦贅。
誰家屏幛得君畫，更以吾詩疏其底。

康不領此詩也, 又有許梅谷者仍求, 又賦長律。
濃寫花枝澹寫梢，鱗皴老榦墨微燋。
筆分三踢攢成瓣，珠暈一圓工點椒。
糝缀蜂鬚凝笑靨，穩拖鼠尾施長條。
盡吹心側風初急，猶把枝埋雪半銷。
松竹襯時明掩映，水波浮處見飄颻。
黃昏時候朧明月，清淺谿山長短橋。
鬧裏相挨如有意，靜中背立見無聊。
筆端的瀝明非畫，軸上縱橫不是描。
頓覺坐成春盎[缺一字]，因思行過雨瀟瀟。
從頭摠是揚湯法，拚下工夫豈一朝 。

王翠巌寫竹求詩，亦與。
古畫畫物無定形，隨物賦形皆迫真。
其次祖述有師繩，如印印泥隨前人。
尚疑屋下重作屋，參以新意意乃足。
晉魏而成幾百年，羲獻斷弦誰解續。
何况高束李杜編，江湖競買新詩讀。
願君種取渭川一千畝，飽飯逍遙步捫腹。
風晴烟雨盡入君心胸，吐出毫端自森肅。
員大夫來子章何碌碌。

三詩蓋梅竹譜也, 然胸中無詩者見之捍格。翠巌得詩後數月忽問余曰:“所求畫竹詩耳, 乃及李、杜編，何也？”余笑曰：“非君不解, 世無人為君言耳。‘作詩必此詩, 定非能詩人。’不聞此語耶？”皇甫表工學於斯, 聞余詩欣然求書, 正恐胸中無詩種, 又捍格也。識者為余一撥, 余老不事多言云。景定元禩良月六日, 所寓邸乃鹽橋王氏家, 二鼓燭下書諸。王孫趙孟堅子固彝齋居士記。

Zigu (Zhao Mengjian) was my oldest friend. The poems and paintings I received from him are more than those from others. In the bingchen year of the Baoyou reign era (1256), he and Zhengweng (Dong Kai董楷, 1226−ca. 1268) collated calligraphic works up to scores of sheets of paper. I perused them fondly, unable to put them aside. Then I made copies under lamplight and finished all the pieces overnight. At daybreak, Zigu, filled with surprise and delight, picked up a brush and wrote a colophon of almost two thousand words. I lost my collection after the war, and the two gentlemen passed away too. One day Huangfu Zichang visited me in Shanyin (Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province) and showed me Zigu’s Poems on Painting Plum Blossoms and Bamboo scroll with Zhengweng’s colophon on it, which Zigu gave him in the gengshen year of the Jingding reign era (1260). I read it over and over again, feeling as if seeing their faces. Zichang was actually Zigu’s cousin, while Zhengweng was my wife’s brother. Overjoyed as if seeing them in person, I sighed again and recorded my feeling here. Twenty-nine years later, in the mid-summer of the wuzi year (1288), Qian Yingsun, Dingzhi, from Bianyang wrote this. [Seals]: Qian Yingsun yin, Juquan, Shulin

Painting is said to be “soundless poetry,” in which the virtuous and the wise express their mind. It can be divided into the divine and the skillful classes. Painters of the divine class are talented with lofty vision. Wielding the brush spontaneously, they are born with the ability to paint. Painters of the skillful class follow established traditions. Using the brush with prescribed methods, they learn how to paint.
My fraternal cousin Yizhai (Zhao Mengjian) was born intelligent and had a lofty character. In addition to literary compositions and calligraphy, he amused himself with brush and ink to paint various flowers. From his swiftly moving brush, flowers emerged in pure and high spirit. They are vivid marvels that belong to the divine class. In the spring of the yimao year (1255), Zichang arrived from Piling [in Jiangsu Province], and Yizhai kept him to help with scholarly pursuits. Out of affectionate admiration, he took Yizhai as his mentor. Through verbal instruction and brush demonstration, he emulated his art without a break. In the autumn that year, as Yizhai joined the staff of Master Huo [Jia Sidao賈似道, 1213−1275], Zichang left to take residence in Gao Wenchang’s Yanyu Lou Studio. There he lived elegantly in leisure and practiced art regularly. As his hand responded to what his mind understood, his art gradually advanced into a higher realm. A few years later, Yizhai praised it for its refinement. Wouldn’t Zichang be the one who succeeds in transmitting Zigu’s legacy! Although Yizhai has passed away, Zichang is making progress every day and feel exhilarated when his works appear comparable. He brought Yizhai’s poetry scroll on painting methods over and asked me to write a few words. I greatly admire his firm determination and hope his art will transcend the skillful class, so I am quoting Master Shangu’s (Huang Tingjian黃庭堅, 1045−1105) inscription on a painting by Danian ( Zhao Lingrang趙令穰, active ca. 1070–1100) of the [Song] imperial family, “Danian learned from Dongpo ( Su Shi蘇軾, 1037−1101) in depicting bamboo and rocks. His paintings have a particular thoughtful nuance but the brushwork feels soft, which is due to his young age. When Danian gets old, his works will be ten times better than those of today.” These are insightful remarks. May Zichang keep them in mind to spur himself on. In the mid-autumn of the wuchen year of the Xianchun reign era (1268) Zhao Mengying inscribed. [Seals]: Junze, Fangzhou, Zhizhai, Yanyi wang Gongji Xiaokang wang Zhongwei zhi yi

In the past, Li Boshi’s (Li Gonglin李公麟, ca. 1041–1106) younger cousin Qiao Zhongchang (11th−12th c.) learned painting from him in person and became a painter of the skillful class. Nowadays Qiao’s works are rarely seen and their value is barely lower than Longmian’s (Li Gonglin). When the mind is kept from distraction, concentration will lead to the divine. May Zichang encourage himself with this. Zichang is young and full of aspiration. Through deep exploration he will achieve self-realization and become a master of his own.

In my childhood I kept company with my elder brother Yizhai, and saw that, upon getting small hanging scrolls by Taochan (Yang Buzhi揚補之, 1097–1171) and handscrolls by Xian’an (Tang Zhengzhong湯正仲, Yang’s nephew), he would constantly roll and unroll them for viewing. That’s how he fully grasped the wonder of Yang’s and Tang’s art. My late brother loved book-learning. No matter what he did, he would not stop until he had reached the finest stage. He was interested in brush and ink throughout his life. Other than that, he had no worldly interest at all. If someone focuses his mind on something, he will become skillful at it, and skillfulness leads to refinement. How could latecomers achieve this! My paintings of “this gentleman” [bamboo] had always received Yizhai’s praise. Although I followed the methods of Wen Tong文同 (1018–1079) and Su Shi蘇軾 (1037–1101), my brushwork actually derived from Yizhai. Cousin Huangfu used to keep company with Yizhai, and that is the origin of his painting. My late brother is gone. I hope you will keep it up. Written in the Qingyuan Lou Studio on the day of “slight heat” [variously on July 6–8] in the wuchen year of the Xianchun reign era (1268).

6. Ye Longli 葉隆禮 (jinshi degree 1247), 18 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1267; 1 seal:

My friend Zhao Zigu (Zhao Mengjian), a descendant of the imperial family, had the flair of people of the Jin (266–420) and Song (420–479) dynasties. In his youth he practiced calligraphy and painting and was fond of orchid as a subject. He often carried brush and inkstone with him while drinking or appreciating flowers. When asked for paintings by people, he complied without grudging. As his works were usually easy to get and plenty to keep, people did not treasure them. In old age, he retreated into Chan Buddhism and became skillful in depicting plum blossoms and bamboo, which were vividly life-like. When I returned from Jiangyou [Jiangxi], I had attained certain insight into Chan-inspired brushwork. I was about to show Zigu my works for his advice, but he had passed away. Townsmen said that the reputation and the price of Zigu’s works had jumped so much recently that a small piece could fetch hundreds or thousands of cash. I dared not believe it. One day a bookseller brought a few pieces to my place, and that news turned out to be true. Isn’t it that people do not value what they have but value what they do not have! Mr. Huangfu is a follower of Zigu’s. He showed me a genuine scroll by Zigu of collected remarks on painting and a painting of orchids by himself. I was overjoyed to view them, but also sighed that there wouldn’t be more works from Zigu and it was good enough to get something close to Zigu’s. May Mr. Huangfu keep up his pursuit. Longli wrote this in the Chunyong Tang Studio on the last day of the fifth month in the dingmao year of the Xianchun reign era (June 23, 1267). [Seal]: Ye Longli Shize fu

Spring Dawn over the Elixir Terrace
Painted for Boyong by Tianyou [Lu Guang].
For ten years I wandered, homeless and away from worldly entanglements;
Now, returning home by the river, I see things differently from most others.
Jade like vapor floating in the sky, it is spring but no rain;
Elixir rays emitted from a well turn into clouds at dawn.
Standing in the wind I lean on my dragon staff;
I have long missed hearing your mouth-organ music by moonlight.
I am happy to be with the venerable immortal, and away from the military strategists;
We sit looking at paintings and talk about literature.[1]

《丹臺春曉圖》
天游為伯顒畫。
十年客邸絕塵紛，江上歸來思不羣。
玉氣浮空春不雨，丹光出井曉成雲。
風前龍杖時堪倚，月下鸞笙久不聞。
幸對仙翁遠孫子，坐中觀畫又論文。

1. 3 columns in standard script [Chapter 2: Filial Piety in the Son of Heaven天子章第二, illustration not extant]:

He who loves his parents will not dare to hate any man….. (p. 85)[1]

…..愛親者不敢惡于人，…..於囗親囗囗囗囗囗囗也。…..

2. 4 columns in standard script [Chapter 3: Filial Piety in the Princes of State 諸侯章第三]:

When a prince is not proud and arrogant, he will not incur peril in spite of his high position. By exercising self-restraint he is judicious, ever keeping a proper balance between his need and use of material things. By such moderation his cup of wealth is full without wasteful overflow. And thus, preserving wealth and rank, he will be able to retain possession of his altars of the land and the grain and keep his subjects in peace. This is the filial piety for the prince of state. It is said in the Book of Songs:
Be apprehensive, be cautious,
As if on the brink of a deep abyss,
As if treading on thin ice. (p. 88)

囗上不驕，高而不危。制節謹度，滿而不溢。高而不危，囗囗囗囗也。滿而不溢，所以長守富也。富貴不離囗囗，囗囗能保其社稷，而和其民人，蓋諸侯之孝也。《詩》囗：“囗囗兢兢，如臨深淵，如履薄冰。”

3. 5 columns in standard script [Chapter 4: Filial Piety in High Ministers and Great Officers 卿大夫章第四]:

They do not presume to wear robes other than those appointed by the laws of the ancient kings, nor to speak words other than those sanctioned by them, nor to exhibit conduct other than that exemplified by their virtuous ways. Thus, none of their words being contrary to those sanctions, and none of their actions contrary to the Way, from their mouths there comes no objectionable speech, and in their conduct there are found no objectionable actions. Their words may fill all under heaven, yet no error of speech will be found in them. Their actions may fill all under heaven, yet no dissatisfaction or dislike will be awakened by them. When these three things are all complete, and as they should be, they can then preserve their ancestral temples. This is the filial piety of high ministers and great officers. In the Book of Songs it is said:
He is never idle, day or night,
In the service of the One Man. (p. 93)

囗囗王之法服，不敢服。非先王之法言，不敢道。非先王之德行，不敢行。 是故非法不言，非道不行，囗無囗囗囗無擇行，言滿天下無囗過， 行滿天下無怨惡。三者囗囗囗囗能守其宗廟，盖卿大夫之孝也。《詩》 云： “夙夜囗囗囗事一人。”

4. 4 columns in standard script [Chapter 5: Filial Piety in Lesser Officials 士章第五]:

As they serve their fathers, so they serve their mothers, and they love them equally. As they serve their fathers, so they serve their rulers, and they reverence them equally. Hence, love is what is chiefly rendered to the ruler, while both of these things are given to the father. Therefore, when they serve their ruler with filial piety they are loyal; when they serve their superior with reverence they are obedient. Not failing in this loyalty and obedience in serving those above them, they are then able to preserve their emoluments and positions, and to maintain their sacrifices. This is the filial piety of the lesser officials. It is said in the Book of Songs:
Rising early and going to sleep late,
Do not disgrace those who gave you birth. (p. 98)

囗囗事父以事母，而愛同。資於事父以事君，而敬同。故母取其囗囗囗取其敬，兼之者父也。故以孝事君，則忠以敬事長則順，忠囗囗囗以事其上，然後能保其祿位，而守囗祭祀，盖士之孝也。囗囗囗興夜寐，無忝爾囗生。

5. 3 columns in standard script [Chapter 6: Filial Piety in the Common People 庶人章第六, illustration not extant]:

They follow the course of heaven, and distinguish the advantages of the soil; they are careful of their conduct, and economical in their expenditure—all in order to nourish their parents. This is the filial piety of the common people. In this way, from the Son of Heaven down to the common people, there has never been one whose filial piety was without its beginning or its end upon whom calamity did not fall. (p. 102)

用天之道，分地之利，謹身節用，以養父母，此囗人之孝也。 故囗天子至於庶人，孝無終始，而患囗及者，未之有也。

6. 6 columns in standard script [Chapter 7: Filial Piety in Relation to the Three Powers三才章第七]:

Zengzi said, “Immense indeed is the greatness of filial piety!” The Master replied, “Yes, filial piety is the constant pattern of heaven, the righteousness of earth, and the duty of man. Heaven and earth inevitably pursue their course, and the people take it as their pattern. The ancient kings imitated the brilliant luminaries of heaven, and acted in accordance with the advantages afforded by the earth, and were thus in accord with all under heaven. Consequently, their teachings were successful without being severe, and their government secured perfect order without being repressive. The ancient kings, seeing how their teachings could transform the people, set before them therefore an example of the most extended love, and none of the people neglected their parents; they set forth to them the example of virtue and righteousness, and the people roused themselves to the practice of them; they went before them with reverence and yielding courtesy, and the people had no contentions; they led them by the rules of propriety and by music, and the people were harmonious and benign; they showed them what they liked and disliked, and the people understood their prohibitions. It is said in the Book of Songs:
Awe-inspiring are you, O Grand Master Yin,
And all of the people look up to you.” (p. 105)

曾子曰：“甚哉。孝之大也。”子曰：“夫孝，天之經也。”地之義囗，民之行也。天地之經，而民是則之，則天之明，因地之利，以囗天下。是以其教不肅而成，其政不嚴而治。先王見囗囗可以化民囗，是故先之以博愛，而民莫遺其親。陳之以德囗，而民興行。先之以敬讓，而民不爭。導之以禮樂，而民和囗。示之以好惡，而民知禁。《詩》云：‘赫赫師尹，民具爾瞻。’”

7. 7 columns in standard script [Chapter 8: Filial Piety in Government 孝治章第八]:

The Master said, “In former times, when the intelligent kings by means of filial piety ruled all under heaven, they did not dare to receive with disrespect the ministers even of small states. How much less would they have dared with dukes, marquises, counts, and barons! Thus it was that they got the myriad states to serve with joyful hearts their royal ancestors.
“The rulers of states did not dare to slight wifeless men and widows. How much less would they slight their officers and subjects! Thus it was that they got all the people to serve with joyful hearts the rulers, their predecessors.
“The heads of clans did not dare to slight their servants and concubines. How much less would they slight their wives and sons! Thus it was that they got the men in the service of their parents with joyful hearts.
“In such a state of things, the parents, while alive, reposed in their songs; and when sacrificed to, their disembodied spirits enjoyed the offerings made to them. Thus, everywhere under heaven, peace and harmony prevailed; disaster and calamities did not occur; misfortunes and rebellions did not arise. It is said in the Book of Songs:
To upright and virtuous conduct
In all the four quarters of the state,
render obedient homage.” (p. 109)

子曰：“昔者明王之以孝治天下也，不敢遺小國之臣，而□於公、侯、伯、子、男乎，故得萬國之懽心。以事其先王。治國囗不敢侮於鰥寡，而況於士民乎，故得百姓之懽心，囗事其先君。治家者不敢失於臣妾，而況於妻子乎，故得人之懽心，以事其親。夫然，故生則親安之，祭則鬼享囗。是以天下和平，災害不生，禍亂不作。故明王之以孝治天下也如此。《詩》 云：‘有覺德行，四國順之。’”

8. 14 columns in standard script [Chapter 9: The Government of the Stages 聖治章第九]:

Zengzi said, “I venture to ask whether in the virtues of the sages there was not something greater than filial piety.” The Master replied, “Of all the living natures produced by heaven and earth, man is the noblest. Of all the actions of man, there is none greater than filial piety. In filial piety there is nothing greater than the reverential awe of one’s father. In the reverential awe shown to one’s father there is nothing greater than making him the companion of heaven. The duke of Zhou was the man who first did this. Formerly, at the border altar, the duke of Zhou sacrificed to Houji as the companion of heaven, and in the Bright Hall he honored King Wen, and sacrificed to him as the companion of God. As a consequence, all of the princes within the Four Seas came to offer assistance in the performance of the sacrifices. In the virtue of the sages, what is there greater than filial piety? Now, the feelings of affection grow at the parents’ knees, and as the nourishing of the parents is practiced those affections merge into awe. The sages proceeded from awe to reverence, and from affection to love. The teaching of the sages, without being severe, were successful, and their government, without being rigorous, was effective. What they proceeded from was the roof of filial piety. The relationship and duties between father and son are of heaven-sent nature, and hold the principle of righteousness between ruler and subject. The son derives his life from his parents, and no greater gift can be transmitted. Ruler and parents in one, his gather deals with him accordingly, and there is no generosity greater than this. Therefore, he who does not love his parents, but instead loves other men, is called a rebel against virtue. He who does not revere his parents, but reveres instead other men, is called a rebel against propriety. When a ruler himself thus acts contrary to that which should place him in accord with all men, he presents nothing for the people to imitate. He has nothing to do with what is good, but entirely and only with what is injurious to virtues. Though he may succeed, the superior man does not give him approval. It is not so with the superior man. He speaks, having thought whether the words should be spoken; he acts, having thought whether his actions are certain to give pleasure. His virtue and righteousness are such as will be honored; what he initiates and carries out is fit to be imitated; his deportment is worthy of contemplation; his movements in advancing or retiring are all according to the proper rule. In this way does he present himself to the people, who both revere and love him, imitate and become like him. Thus he is able to make his teaching of virtue successful, and his government and orders to be carried into effect. It is said in the Book of Songs:
The virtuous man, the princely one,
Has no flaw in his deportment.” (p. 113)

曾子曰：“敢問聖人之德，無以加於孝乎。”子曰：“天地之囗囗人為貴。人之行，莫大於孝。孝莫大於嚴父，嚴父莫大囗配天，則周公其人也。昔者周公郊祀后稷，以配天。宗祀囗王於明堂，以配上帝。是以四海之內，各以其職來祭。夫聖囗囗之德，又何以加於孝乎。故親生之膝下，以養父母日嚴。聖囗因嚴以教敬，因親以教愛。聖人之教不肅而成，其政不嚴而治， 其所因者本也。父子之道，天性也。君臣之義也。父母生之，續莫大焉。君親臨之，厚莫重焉。故不愛其親而愛它人者，謂之悖德。不敬其親而敬他人者，謂之悖禮。囗順則逆民，無則焉不在於善，而皆在於凶德。雖得之，君子不貴也。君子則不然，言思可道，行思可樂，德義可尊，作事可法，容止可觀，進退可度，以臨其民。是以其民畏而愛，則而象之。故能成其德教，而行其政令。《詩》云：‘淑人君子，其儀不忒。’”

9. 5 columns in standard script [Chapter 10: An orderly Description of the Acts of Filial Piety 紀孝行章第十]:

The Master said, “The service which a son renders to his parents is as follows. In his general conduct toward them he manifests the utmost reverence. In his nourishing of them, his endeavor is to give them the utmost pleasure. When they are ill, he feels the greatest anxiety. In mourning for them, he exhibits every manifestation of grief. In sacrificing to them, he displays the utmost solemnity. When a son is complete in these five things, he is able to serve his parents. He who thus serves his parents, in a high situation, will be free from pride; in a low situation, will be free from insubordination; and, among his equals, will not be quarrelsome. In a high situation pride leads to ruin; in a low situation insubordination leads to punishment; among equals quarrelsomeness leads to the wielding of weapons. If those three things be not put away, even though a son every day contributes beef, mutton, and pork to nourish his parents, he is not filial.” (p. 118)

子曰：“孝子之事親也，居則致其敬，養則致其樂，病則致其憂，喪則致其哀，祭則致其嚴，五者備矣，然後能事親。事親者，居上不驕，為下不亂，在醜不爭，居上而驕，則亡。為下而亂，則刑。在醜而爭，則兵。三者不除，雖日用三牲之養，猶為不孝也。”

10. 2 columns in standard script [Chapter 11: Filial Piety in Relation to the Five Punishments 五刑章第十一]:

The Master said, “There are three thousand offenses against which the five punishments are directed, and there is not one of them greater than being unfilial. When constraint is put upon a ruler, that is the disowning of his superiority. When the authority of the sages is disallowed, that is the disowning of law. When filial piety is put aside, that is the disowning of the principle of affection. This paves the way to anarchy.” (p. 122)

子曰：“五刑之屬三千，而罪莫大於不孝，要君者無上，非聖人者無法，非孝者無親，此大亂之道也。”

11. 4 columns in standard script [Chapter 12: Amplification of “The All-Embracing Rule of Conduct” in Chapter 1廣要道章第十二]:

The Master said, “For teaching the people to be affectionate and loving there is nothing better than filial piety. For teaching them propriety and submissiveness there is nothing better than fraternal duty. For changing their manners and altering their customs there is nothing better than music. For securing the repose of superiors and the good order of the people there is nothing better than propriety. Propriety is simply respect. Therefore, the respect paid to one’s father pleases all sons; the respect paid to one’s elder brother pleases all younger sons; the respect paid to one’s ruler pleases all subjects. The respect paid to one man pleases thousands and myriads of men. The respect is paid to a few and the pleasure extends to many—this is what is meant by the Essential Way.” (p. 127)

子曰：“教民親愛，莫善於孝。教民禮順，莫善於悌。移風易俗，莫善於樂。安上治民，莫善於禮。禮者，敬而已矣。故敬其父，則子悅。敬其兄，則弟悅。敬其君，則臣悅。敬一人而千萬人悅。所敬者寡而悅者眾，此謂之要道也。”

12. 4 columns in standard script [Chapter 13: Amplification of “The Perfect Virtue” in Chapter 1 廣至德章第十三]:

The master said, “The teaching of filial piety by the superior man does not require that he should go to family after family, and daily see the members of each. His teaching of filial piety is a tribute of reverence to all the fathers under heaven. His teaching of fraternal submission is a tribute of reverence to all the elder brothers under heaven. His teaching of the duty of a subject is a tribute of reverence to all the rulers under heaven. It is said in the Book of Songs:
The happy and courteous sovereign
Is the parent of the people.
“If it were not a perfect virtue, how could it be recognized as in accordance with their nature by the people so extensively as this?” (p. 132)

子曰：“君子之教以孝也，非家至而日見之也。教以孝，所囗天下之為人父者也。教以悌，所以敬天下之為人兄者也。教以臣，所以敬天下之囗人君者也。《詩》云：‘愷悌君子，民之父母。’非至德，其孰能順民如此其大者乎。”

13. 3 columns in standard script [Chapter 14: Amplification of “Making Our Name Famous” in Chapter 1 廣揚名章第十四]:

The Master said, “The filial piety with which the superior man serves his parents may be transferred as loyalty to the ruler. The fraternal duty with which he serves the eldest brother may be transferred as submissive deference to elders. His regulation of his family may be transferred as good government in any official position. Therefore, when his conduct is thus successful in his inner circle, his name will be established for future generations.” (p. 136)

子曰：“君子之事親孝，故忠可移於君。事兄悌，故順可移於長。居家理，故治可移於官。是故以行成於內，而名立於後世。”

14. 7 columns in standard script [Chapter 15: Filial Piety in Relation to Reproof and Remonstrance 諫諍章第十五]:

Zengzi said: “I have heard your instructions on the affection of love, on respect and reverence, on giving repose to our parents, and on making our names famous. I would venture to ask if simple obedience to the orders of one’s father can be pronounced filial piety?” The Master replied: “What words are these! What words are these! In former times, if the Son of Heaven had seven ministers who would remonstrate with him, although he had not right methods of government, he would not lose possession of his kingdom; if the prince of a state had five such ministers, though his measures might be equally wrong, he would not lose his state; if a great officer had three, he would not, in a similar case, lose his clan; if an inferior officer had a friend who would remonstrate with him, a good name would not cease to be connected with his character; and the father who had a son that would remonstrate with him would not sink into the gulf or unrighteous deeds. Therefore, where a case of unrighteous conduct is concerned, a son must by no means keep from remonstrating with his father, nor a minister from remonstrating with his ruler. Hence, since remonstrance is required in the case of unrighteous conduct, how can simple obedience to the order of a father be accounted filial piety?” (p. 137)

囗囗曰：“若夫慈孝愛恭敬，安親揚名，則聞命矣。敢問囗囗父之令，可謂孝乎？”子曰：“是何言與？是何言與？昔者天子有爭臣七人，雖無道不失其天下。諸侯有爭臣囗囗，雖無道不失其國。大夫有爭臣三人，雖無道不失其家。囗有爭友，則身不離於令名。父有爭子，則身不陷於不義。囗當不義，則子不可以不爭於父， 臣不可以不爭於君，故囗不義則爭之，從父之令，又焉得為孝乎。”

15. 5 columns in standard script [Chapter 16: The Influence of Filial Piety and the Response to It 感應章第十六]:

The Master said, “In former times, the intelligent kings served their fathers with filial piety, and therefore they served earth with discrimination. They pursued the right course with reference to their seniors and juniors, and therefore they secured the regulation of the relations between superiors and inferiors everywhere. When heaven and earth were served with intelligence and discrimination, their spiritual intelligences displayed themselves. Therefore, even the Son of Heaven must have some whom he honors; that is, he has his uncles of his surname. He must have some to whom he concedes precedence; that is, he has his cousins, who bear the same surname, and are older than himself. In the ancestral temple he manifests the utmost reverence, showing that he does not forget his parents. He cultivates his person and is careful of his conduct, fearing lest he should disgrace his predecessors. When in the ancestral temple he exhibits the utmost reverence, the spirits of the departed manifest themselves. Perfect filial piety and fraternal duty reach to the spiritual intelligences, and diffuse their light on all within the Four Seas. They penetrate everywhere. It is said in the Book of Songs:
From the west to the east,
From the south to the north,
There was not a thought but did him homage.” (p. 143)

子曰：“昔者明王事父孝，故事天明事母孝，故事地察，長幼順，故上下治，天地明察，神明彰矣。故雖天子必有尊也，言有父囗必有先也。言有兄也，宗廟致敬，不忘親也。脩身慎行，恐辱先也。宗廟致敬，鬼神著矣。 孝悌之至，通於神明，光於乎四海，囗所不通。《詩》云：‘自西自東，自南自北，無思不服。’”

16. 7 columns in standard script [Chapter 17: The Service of the Ruler 事君章第十七]:

The Master said, “The superior man serves his ruler in such a way that, when at court in his presence, his thought is how to discharge his loyal duty to the utmost; and, when he retires from it, his thought is how to amend his errors. He carries out with deference the measures springing from his ruler’s excellent qualities, and rectifies him only to preserve him from what is evil. Hence, as superior and inferior they are able to have affection for one another. It is said in the Book of Songs:
In my heart I love him so,
And why should I not say so?
In the core of my heart I keep him,
And never will forget him.” (p. 147)

子曰：“君子之事上也，進思盡忠，退思補過，將順其美，匡救囗惡，故上下能相親也。《詩》 云：‘心乎愛矣，遐不謂矣，中心藏之，囗日忘之。’”

17. 6 columns in standard script, illustration between columns 4 and 5 [Chapter 18: Filial Piety in Mourning for Parents 喪親章第十八]:

The Master said, “When a filial son is mourning for a parent, he wails, but not with a prolonged sobbing; in the movements of ceremony, he pays no attention to his appearance; his words are without elegance of phrase; he cannot bear to wear fine clothes; when he hears music, he feels no delight; when he eats a delicacy, he is not conscious of its flavor. Such is the nature of grief and sorrow.
“After three days, he may partake of food; for thus the people are taught that the living should not be injured on account of the dead, and that emaciation must not be carried to the extinction of life. Such is the rule of the sages. The period of mourning does not extend beyond three years, to show the people that it must have an end.
“An inner and an outer coffin are made; the grave clothes also are put on, and the shroud; and the body is lifted into the coffin. The sacrificial vessels, round and square, are set forth, and cause further distress. The women beat their breasts and the men stamp their feet, wailing and weeping, while they sorrowfully escort the coffin to the grave. They consult the tortoiseshell to determine the grave and the ground about it, and they lay the body in peace. They prepare the ancestral temple, and there present offerings to the disembodied spirit. In the spring and autumn they offer sacrifices, thinking of the deceased as the seasons come round.
“The services of love and reverence to parents when alive, and those of grief and sorrow when they are dead—these completely discharge the fundamental duty of living men. The righteous claims of life and death are all satisfied, and the filial son’s service to his parents is completed.” (p. 150) Gonglin

子曰：“孝之喪親也，哭不偯，禮無容。言不文服美不安，聞樂不樂，囗旨不甘，此哀戚之情也。三日而食，教民無以死傷生，毀不滅性，囗囗人之政也。喪不過三年示民有終也。為之棺槨衣衾而舉之，陳其簠簋而哀慼之。擗踊哭泣，哀以送之，卜其宅兆，而安措之。為之宗廟，以鬼享之。春秋祭祀，以時節之思，生事愛囗，死事哀囗，生民之本囗矣，死生之義備矣，孝子之事親終矣。” 公麟

…… Is there not a deep and mysterious destiny of brush and ink, protected by a guardian deity who will not permit this holy thing to leave this land? This scroll, which illustrates the Classic of Filial Piety, is a legacy from the worthies of old. Its affinity to the renowned teachings of Confucius is great indeed! It is worthy of esteem therefore not merely because its excellence of brush and ink is unsurpassed through all time. Those who follow me should think deeply and long on this that they might guard and protect it without remiss. (p. 162) [Seals]: Chen Ying siyin, Qian’an

李伯時 《孝經圖》 卷，書法鍾、王，畫追顧、陸，董文敏稱為二絕，洵希世之珍也。據董跋是卷以已酉年歸新安劉幼真太學家，當是萬歷[曆]三十七年，[1609]至國朝嘉慶已卯[1819]歸予家，凡二百十矣。中間收藏可考者，明人為劉太學；入本朝則汪廷璋，廷璋字令聞，歙邑富商，嘗為是卷造孝經樓以貯之，備極珍重；後又歸畢尚書沅之弟畢瀧家。已卯[1819]歲予購於繁昌鮑氏，獲歸齋中。劉太學暨汪令聞皆徽郡人，畢尚書本籍新安，予亦籍隸新安，計二百數十年中，此卷展轉皆未出吾郡，豈非翰墨緣深冥冥者有默相呵護，使神物不離斯土耶？是卷圖寫 《孝經》，先賢遺蹟有關於名教甚大，不僅以筆墨之妙超前絕後為足重也。後之人所宜深思永念，以期慎守，勿失焉矣。洪瑩記。 [印]： 臣瑩私印、鈐庵

8. Bi Long 畢瀧 (1730–1797), 3 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 1 seal:

Of the paintings attributed to Li Gonglin that I have seen, eight or nine out of every ten have been forgeries. As for this Xiaojing tu, not only is the quality of the painting itself lofty but the calligraphy, too, is of unsurpassed excellence. It deserves to be called the finest Longmian [Li Gonglin] painting in the world; a treasure worth 10,000 gold. Recorded by Bi Long. (p. 161) [Seal]: Bi Long qingshang

9. Bi Long 畢瀧 (1730–1797), 6 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 3 seals:

In the Collected Colophons of Su Shih (Dongpo tiba), there is a colophon to Li Boshi's Xiaojing tu: ""When we look at these pictures, feelings of warm, loving duty and loyalty toward our parents well up within us. Its superb brushwork is not inferior to that of Gu Kaizhi and Lu Tanwei. As for the final chapter, in which all that a son finds unbearable is described, the painter has conveys these meanings in only the faintest suggestion of form. None but a truly superior man possessing the Way could achieve this level. Gu and Lu did not reach it."" The painting that Su Shi inscribed was in all probability this one. His colophon was simply cut off during the period of Emperor Huizong's ban on his calligraphy. [Signed] Zhuchi (p. 161) [Seals]: Jingyi, Jianfei

《東坡題跋》 中載 〈跋李伯時孝經圖〉云：“觀此畫者易直子諒之心油然生矣。筆迹之妙不減顧、陸。”至第十八章，人子之所不忍者，獨寄其髣髴非有道君子不能為，殆非顧、陸之所及。” 東坡所跋大約即此卷也。是禁蘇書時割去耳。竹癡 [印]： 靜逸、澗飛

10. Bi Long 畢瀧 (1730–1797), 5 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1791; 1 seal:

In Chen Meigong's [Chen Jiru's] Nigulu it says: ""Of Li Gonglin's calligraphy, Huang Tingjian said, 'He penetrated the secrets of calligraphy through the doorway of painting.'"" As we look now at the small kai script of the Xiaojing, a spiritual brilliance radiates from the primitive brushstrokes, and we can perceive the pattern of the ancient li [clerical] script still preserved in it. As to the excellence of the brushwork of the painting, as Dong Qichang said, it directly follows Gu Kaizhi. Truly it is one of the rarest treasures of the age! I would not exchange this scroll for a thousand in gold! Xinhai [1791], fifteenth day of the first month, after the snow cleared, again recorded by Zhuchi. (p. 161) [Seal]: Long

12. Bi Long畢瀧 (1730–1797), 6 columns in semi-cursive script, undated; 2 seals with 1 illegible:

Wang Tingzhang of Shexian, also called Lingwen, was a wealthy merchant of Yangzhou, a man of considerable culture and elegance. Among his retainers was a certain Qiu Yugao who once wrote an account of a long handscroll by Li Longmian transcribing and illustrating the Classic of Filial Piety that was owned by Wang. He obtained it for a price of 1,200 gold, and then built a Hall of the Classic of Filial Piety in his garden using only precious cedarwood. He was one who truly guards and cherishes his precious possessions! I too knew from afar of the fame of the scroll, but I was never able to see it. In only a few years, however, Wang had passed away, and now the painting has unexpectedly come to me. One can only say that objects gather about those who love them. This painting, moreover, is a supernatural thing, and I will guard and preserve it with all my power…... Recorded again by Zhuchi. (pp. 160-61) [Seal]: Zhuchi, 1 illegible

Li Boshi's Xiaojing tu. From each chapter, he selected one or two words to be illustrated. Its dream-like images are astonishingly fine, far superior to the other two paintings [attributed to Li Gonglin], Immortals and Pig Hunt. As for the calligraphy, an earlier writer has said that it vigorously pursues the model of Chung You, and the comment is not an empty one. Yao Xibao [Yao Nai] once said that though he lived in Longmian, in his entire lifetime he had never seen Boshi's painting. Now this inequity has been corrected. In the space of a few years, three precious paintings by Li Boshi have been acquired. The Master should feel contented now. (p. 162)

李伯時畫 《孝經》 筆意秀挺，有春蠶吐絲之妙。楷法古樸，直追魏、晉，真希世之珍也。明劉幼真曾以趙文敏 《撫琴圖》 與董思翁相易，國初藏徐立齋相國家，後歸新安汪令聞，築孝經堂於園中，木皆用楠，極其寶貴。今為陳君寄舫所得，摹泐上石，以公海內，有教孝之意。夫孝天經地義，為百行之先，伯時畫此經有益世教，非尋常山水、人物可比。寄舫事親素有孝行，今刻此經於居憂之時，非所謂死事盡思者乎。噫！可謂孝矣。丁已秋七月覺阿觀。 [印]： 祖觀、 蓮宗弟子

18. Dai Xi 戴熙 (1801–1860), 8 columns in semi-cursive script, datable to 1857; 2 seals (originally inscribed on a rubbing of the Classic of Filial Piety?):

Longmian shanren's Xiaojing tu, together with the text of the classic written in the small kai script. Siweng [Dong Qichang] was completely bowled over by it. He has the calligraphy engraved in the first chapter of Xihongtang. Through that reproduction I was already familiar with its general appearance. As for the painting itself, I had no idea by whom it was owned and enjoyed. Recently however I met the Zhongcheng [Counselor of the Center] Xu Xunchen [Xu Naizhao], and our talk turned to this painting. He spoke with the greatest admiration of the lofty antiquity of the style of the painting and the freedom and purity of the calligraphy. He also told me that Liu Wenqing [Liu Yong], who lived early in this dynasty, had completely based his own style of calligraphy on it. I thirsted for even a glimpse of the scroll, but my wish was never fulfilled. Then, in the fifth intercalary month of dingsi [1857] in the Xianfeng era, Master Wu Guanying of Jiangyin came to visit me, bringing with him a rubbing made from a stone engraving of the entire scroll made by Master Chen Jifang, and at long last I had the privilege of seeing this holy object. Stunned with awe and admiration, I realized that everything Xunweng had said of it was indeed true!...... (p. 164) [Seals]: Dai Xi, Chunshi

When the myriad Buddhist fates are swept away, the true Confucian scholar is revealed.

20. Chen Shijin 陳式金 (mid-19th c.), 16 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1857; 2 seals:

Extant authentic works of the Song and Yuan periods are extremely rare. I have been searching for them for many years, and have succeeded in finding only a few. In the spring of the year dingwei [1847], Wu Zizhong [Wu Zhun] saw at the home of Mr. Wen in the capital Li Longmian's Xiaojing tu, the transcription and illustration of the Classical of Filial Piety, an authentic work. He sent me a letter praising the work, and as I had long been impressed by Master Wu's connoisseurship, I asked him to buy it and have it brought back to me. The scroll is well over ten feet long, on silk; each chapter of the text is accompanied by an illustration. The figures are antique and respectful, the brushwork pure and vigorous, embodying strength in pliancy—truly a work that reveals the artistic merit and profound thought of a scholar. In his calligraphy in the kai, or model, script he used very thick ink. The effect he achieves with the brush is pure and unsophisticated; the tip of the brush is withdrawn, its edge concealed. It follows the concepts of Zhong Taifu [Zhong You]. Unfortunately, both the text and the illustration of chapter 1 are lost, and the illustrations of the chapters on the emperor and the common people are lost as well. Although there are numerous other areas of loss and damage, none is excessive. As for the transmission of the painting, the forest of colophons by famous men suffices to prove that it has long been treasured and esteemed. When the boat on which the scroll was sent me by post was turning around at Wumen, a boatman accidently dropped it into the water. Thanks to the strength and firmness of the wrapping, however, the water did not penetrate through to the painting itself. Truly, holy things are protected by the gods! And yet they can still encounter grave danger! I was moved by this, and decided to entrust the scroll to Master Zhang Cuishan to make an engraving so that it might be transmitted through numberless transformations. The longevity of hard, white stone will enable it to pass through future ages without harm. The silk, however, having survived over 800 years, had turned very dark and it was not easy to trace the painting. Fortunately, Master Wu assisted in the work, and a fine copy was made. We obtained a version that could be engraved consisting of 12 chapters. Chapter 10 [a mistake for chapter 9] had already been reproduced in Xihongtang, and we did not repeat it. As for the rest, wherever the calligraphy or painting had been rubbed off or lost, we repaired it with material drawn from elsewhere in the scroll. With this, Longmian's spirit and the excellence of his art will be fresh and new forever; and his mind, which illumines the sage's classic and thereby assists the world in spreading his teaching, will still be able to clearly explain the meaning of filial piety to philosophers of the future. It is certainly not merely a model for the world of art and nothing more! Dingsi [1857], a summer day, recorded by Chen Shijin. (p. 163) [Seals]: Jifang, Shiyuan

宋、元真跡存世甚稀，余搜羅年久，僅得數種。丁未春吳君子重由都門溫氏見李龍眠畫 《孝經圖》，並書經文真跡，寄書嘆賞君之審鑒，余素服膺屬為購歸。卷長丈餘，絹本，一章一圖。人物古穆，筆意清勁，寓剛於柔，真士夫功力深沉之作。楷書用筆，墨甚濃，筆致淳樸，斂鋒藏鍔，有鍾太傅意。惜〈開宗明義章〉圖文全缺。〈天子章〉、〈庶人章〉圖畫亦缺，其餘損處雖多，均無礙畫位。名跋林立，信其為世寶貴久矣。當郵寄歸至吳門轉航時，巻為舟子墜水中，藉封緘固密，水未著巻，神物信有鬼神呵護，然危亦甚矣。余有感於此，遂屬張子萃山刻之，冀傳億萬化身，庶貞石之壽可歷世而不壞也。惟绢本流傳八百餘年，其色黝黑，影鉤非易，幸吳君相助精摹，得可刻者十二章至紀孝行章，經文已鐫 《戲鴻堂》，茲不重刻。其他字畫有磨滅者，集巻中字補足之，於是龍眠之精神，墨妙常新千古，而其發明聖經、扶世翼教之心，尤足以昭示來哲，豈獨為藝林規範已也。丁巳夏日陳式金識。 [印]： 寄舫，適園

21. Li Hongzhang 李鴻章 (1823–1901), 6 columns in semi-cursive script, dated 1880; 1 seal:

When the ancient men made paintings, their primary purpose was moral instruction. Not a single thought or brushstroke was accidental. Theirs was no ""art for art's sake,"" as in the modern world of art. This excellence of brush and ink in this painting can by no means be regarded as spurious. One can enjoy it from morning till night, seeking to discover wherein lies its meaning. Nor can it be said to be without some small assistance in the path of establishing one's life and serving one's parents…… (p. 164) [Seal]: Shaoquan

一幀湘魂， 正捐璫水濶，汛瑟烟昏。江皐幾樷憔悴，留伴靈均。日莫通詞何許，有嬋媛北渚孤顰。國香縱流落，未許東風換土移根。

經年亡國恨，料銅槃冷透，鉛淚澘痕。故宮天遠，鵝管從此無春。補作宣龢殘譜， 儘消凝老去王孫。不成被花惱，步入鷗波，滿襪秋塵。

壺天樂聚",https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/51548,"Gong Kai
龔開","Translation of inscriptions:

When the scroll is opened we find a blue paper with a Chinese calligraphic writing composed of two characters, the first of which is pot, and the second is heaven.
Translation of the label at the right-hand of the picture: ""Picture representing the merry gatherings in the pot heaven. Genuine painting by Gong Zuiyen (Gong Gai) of the Song dynasty"" (see ""A"" story of the pot heaven).

At the end of the picture is the following: ""The Merry-gathering in the Pot Heaven (the heaven found in the pot). The Great Garden of Beng Laishan (Everlasting Lucky Mountain) is very far away from this world, beyond the river Roshwei (the great stream which separates Mount Beng Laishan from the terrestrial world). Everything on this mountain is quite different from what it is in this world. Many peaks soar high up into the sky, and no flowers and no green trees are to be found.
There are no season, so distinction between spring and summer or autumn and winter. The buildings on the mountainside are made of stone or jade, and the strange looking winged people (Taoists) are gathered together to study the truths of the Taoistic philosophy. Their heads are old and serious; they do not know the affairs of the world, nor do they think of the beginning or end of the world. They keep their feasts in the moon or meet on the sea. And far away in the sky there is a palace.
Deep in the sea there is the Palace of the Dragon. Some people go about making merry, some sit and think of the Taoistic philosophy, some play with supernatural powers, some eat fog, some drink in the sun and transform it into the fiery fruit of the jujube tree. Here we see the twined pears, the icy peaches and snowy lotus flowers; here we find the juice and ointment of the jade which runs as a stream in all directions from the north to the south, from the east to the west. Some float their wine cups on a stream or sitting on the ledge of a precipice compare poems. Some enjoy themselves dancing or making music, some write or paint, some play the lyre or chess. Some, with steps big enough to cross rainbows, reach the roads of heaven to pick stars. Some try to catch the moon, walking across the sky and clouds. Rare birds sing in the shade of a bamboo group and the clear water flows from a fountain; some lean against a pine tree looking at a fishing boat.
Rock dew drops down on the magic plant form, sleet falls on the cliff, fog conceals the ragged walls, clouds cover the rocky peaks and the rock caves, hills stretch here and there. The eight musical notes of nature ring, and the auspicious light shines over creatures and gods. The people of this land, calling for supernatural animals, fly with them to a far away place where cold winds blow and the flower-like snowflakes hover in the sky.
In another part, warm winds scatter beautiful flowers and spread a brocade over the ground. The torrent makes beautiful gems when it runs over the rocks. In the world of changefulness, the Grand Rabbit (by which is meant the world of the moon) is hidden in a grain of millet. An in the black pot is hidden a long picture (a long day?)
The Yin (negative) and the Yang (positive) are the essential principles from which everything in the world has been created. The water meets the heat and forms the lovely clouds moving peacefully. On the other hand the pressure of the vastness of the vault is felt. The walking and sitting persons show the difference between occupation and leisure. The men here wear the rainbow skirts and feather jackets; they put the moon crowns on their heads and grass sandals on their feet. Some carry boxes, spades and pots to get mythical orchids and fungi. All the things here are quite different from the terrestrial world.
All the things are different but the essential principle of Tao (The Way) are one and the same. The unlimited and the limited are but one. The positive and negative are only two phases of the same being. We may say that life had its origin in the essential principle of Tao, and that out of the star at the South Pole is born longevity.

The lonely tear-stained face, teardrops drenching the branches,
Though washed of makeup, her old charms remain.
Behind the closed gate, on a rainy night, how she is filled with sadness.
How differently she looked bathed in golden waves of moonlight, before darkness fell [1].

玉兒風貌雪兒姿，

萬蝶分香渾不管，
溶溶好月在橫枝。萬紅狼藉蝶分香，玉潭句也

酤酒花前雪壓枝，
王孫佳句稱清姿。
人間不少瀛洲雨，
粉墨飄零又一時。
趙承旨題玉潭著色梨花詩云“繁枝壓雪清風塵”，又云“今君酤酒花前歇。”可見玉潭梨花不止此卷，特不知猶在人間世否？
