# chinese-art

## Purpose of this repo

The main purpose of this repo on the Chinese Art Collection project is using Python to pull data from the three mesuems' websites. MET, Smithsonian, and Taipei Gugong are using different APIs.

By far the MET API works, and it can generate a combined CVS file for further import into Omeka S v3.2. File Sideload and Batch Upload plugins are required.

Further works include:

- Add APIs from Smithsonian and Taipei Gugong
- Upgrade Omeka to v.4 to reduce the workload of File Sideload
- Add website decoration works to Omeka
